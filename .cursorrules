-   **agent-use-project-docs.rules.mdc:** Consult project documentation during planning, implementation, and debugging.
-   **auto-test-validation.rules.mdc:** Run tests after every meaningful code change.
-   **changelog.rules.mdc:** Manage changelog files according to standards.
-   **code-quality.mdc:** Enforce code quality guidelines (e.g., no apologies, no summaries).
-   **declare-active-rule.rules.mdc:** Declare the active rule at the start of each response.
-   **display-active-workflow.rules.mdc:** Display workflow progress when executing `.workflow.md` files.
-   **functional-test-principals.rules.mdc:** Ensure tests validate real, end-to-end functionality.

-   **targeted-validation.rules.mdc:** Validate changes by running typecheck, lint, and test commands.
