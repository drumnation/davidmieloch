## Development Workflow

### Storybook-Driven Development Approach
For each component in the application:

1. [ ] Create the component with its content embedded (not injected via Storybook)
2. [ ] Develop the component's Storybook story simultaneously
3. [ ] Ensure the Storybook story mirrors the actual app implementation
4. [ ] Test the component in isolation via Storybook
5. [ ] Integrate the component into the main application
6. [ ] Verify the component behaves identically in both environments

### Component Development Pattern
For each component:

```
src/components/[section]/[ComponentName]/
  ├── index.ts                    # Export the component
  ├── [ComponentName].tsx         # Component implementation with embedded content
  ├── [ComponentName].styles.ts   # Styled components
  ├── [ComponentName].types.ts    # TypeScript interfaces
  └── [ComponentName].stories.tsx # Storybook story
```

### Storybook Story Requirements
Each component story should:

- [ ] Show the component exactly as it will appear in the app
- [ ] Include the actual content (not placeholder content)
- [ ] Demonstrate responsive behavior
- [ ] Include dark/light theme variations
- [ ] Document props and usage
- [ ] NOT define any important functionality that isn't in the main app
- [ ] Share all setup with the main app
