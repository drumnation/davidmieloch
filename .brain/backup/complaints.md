Okay, I've reviewed the Reddit thread (though it's mostly just the initial post and some metadata).  Since there are no comments to analyze, I'll focus on the original poster's description of the situation and pull out potential "disses" and "knocks" that *could* be made, based on what they've presented.  I'll essentially generate the types of comments one might expect.

Here are some potential "disses" about using AI and "knocks" on management, categorized and phrased as if they were Reddit comments:

**Disses about using AI for coding (in this context):**

*   **"Return on Investment" Obsession:**
    *   "Management bought a shiny new toy and now they're desperate to justify the expense, regardless of whether it actually *helps* us."
    *   "Ah yes, the classic 'we spent money on this, so you *must* use it' approach.  Productivity be damned."
    * "They're measuring the wrong thing.  It's like judging a fish by its ability to climb a tree, then buying everyone climbing gear."
    * "Expecting immediate ROI on a tool that fundamentally changes workflow is peak short-sightedness."

*   **Skill Degradation/Over-Reliance:**
    *   "So, they want us to become glorified prompt engineers instead of actual engineers?"
    *    "This is how you create a generation of developers who can't debug their way out of a paper bag without AI."
    *   "Great, now we're outsourcing our thinking to a black box. What could go wrong?"
    *    "I can't wait for the first major outage caused by AI-generated code that nobody on the team actually understands."
*   **Quality Concerns:**
    *   "Garbage in, garbage out.  AI tools are only as good as the prompts and the existing codebase they're trained on."
    *    "Have fun debugging that subtly incorrect AI-generated code that *looks* right at first glance."
    * "Management clearly doesn't understand the difference between *writing* code and *understanding* code."
    *   "This is going to lead to a mountain of technical debt that we'll be paying off for years."

*   **Ignoring Experienced Devs' Input:**
    * "Another example of management making top-down decisions about engineering workflows without consulting the engineers."
    *   "I bet none of the people pushing this mandate actually write code on a daily basis."
    *   "This feels like a solution in search of a problem."
    * "They should be asking us *if* this is helpful, not telling us to use it."
**Knocks on Management:**

*   **Technological Illiteracy/Fad-Chasing:**
    * "Sounds like the CTO watched a few YouTube videos and declared themselves an AI expert."
    *   "This is peak 'shiny object syndrome.' They're chasing the latest trend without understanding the implications."
    *   "Management is more concerned with *appearing* innovative than actually *being* innovative."
    * "They fell for the marketing hype."

*   **Micromanagement/Lack of Trust:**
    * "The 'mandate' part is the real problem. It shows a complete lack of trust in their engineers' judgment."
    *    "This is just another form of micromanagement, disguised as 'innovation'."
    *   "They're treating us like assembly line workers, not skilled professionals."
    *   "If they don't trust us to choose the right tools for the job, why did they hire us?"

*   **Prioritizing Cost Over Quality:**
    *   "They're trying to squeeze more output out of us for the same (or less) cost, without considering the long-term consequences."
    * "This is a race to the bottom in terms of code quality and developer morale."
    *   "Short-term gains, long-term pain. Classic management blunder."
    * "Penny-wise and pound-foolish."

*   **Forced "Integration":**
    *   "Integrating it into *everyone's* workflow is just going to create bottlenecks and frustration for those who don't find it useful."
    * "Forcing a specific tool on everyone, regardless of their individual needs or preferences, is a recipe for disaster."
    *   "One-size-fits-all solutions rarely work in software development."
    *   "It's like forcing everyone to use the same IDE, regardless of their personal preferences or the project requirements."
    * "This will work best for the most junior developers. The experienced devs it is supposed to make faster will be slowed down by it."

I've tried to capture the spirit of a typical r/ExperiencedDevs discussion, which tends to be skeptical of management fads and protective of developer autonomy and code quality. These responses emphasize potential downsides and criticisms, reflecting a common sentiment among experienced developers when faced with top-down mandates that might not be practical or beneficial.
