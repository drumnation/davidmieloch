## The Path Forward

The future of development is here, and the stakes are higher than you might think:

> "It's easy to jump to this cynical take and I'm guilty of it myself. But... better to experiment now and find out how and where it's going to deliver some business value, the alternative is sitting on the fence and then realizing you missed the boat, at which point your competitors have a head start and you likely won't catch them."
> — Engineering Director

Remember: Success with AI tools isn't about replacing developers—it's about empowering them with the right systems, processes, and knowledge. Let's work together to make that happen for your team.
