# From AI Skeptic to AI Integration Expert: My Journey

## The Reality of AI Tools in Development Teams

Let me guess: your team just got access to AI coding tools, and the reactions range from skeptical eye-rolls to outright hostility. I've been there—both as the skeptic and later as the solution architect.

A recent thread on r/ExperiencedDevs caught my eye, where hundreds of senior developers shared their frustrations about mandatory AI tool adoption. The problems are systemic and deeply concerning:

> "One of our OKRs is basically 'Use AI more' and one of the ways they're measuring that is Copilot suggestion acceptance %. Absolute insanity."
> — Engineering Lead

> "Management bought Cursor pro for everyone and said that they expect to see a return on that investment."
> — Senior Developer

> "We're also seeing an increase in failures in Prod, so we need you to really ramp up Copilot and AI code reviews to find the source of these new issues."
> — Project Manager (without realizing the irony)

These quotes highlight a disturbing trend: companies implementing AI tools without proper systems, leading to:

- Metrics that incentivize accepting AI suggestions regardless of quality
- Management viewing AI as primarily a cost-cutting measure
- The ironic situation where AI is both causing problems and being proposed as the solution

But there's another side to this story. When implemented thoughtfully, AI tools can be genuinely transformative:

> "AI has helped me tremendously, but not the way people think it might of. It can't do anything I couldn't do. But if I give it a granular enough task, it does it quickly and very robustly, error handling, great structured debug output etc. It's like having a very eager junior dev and you just tell them what to do."
> — Senior Developer

The key difference? A systematic approach to implementation. As one CTO put it:

> "I get to hear our CTOs thoughts on various topics every week. I suppose I'm lucky that he's aware that AI is both a powerful tool as well as a powerful foot-gun."

One comment particularly resonated:

> "Management dropped this on us last week—'All PRs must now use AI assistance for initial implementation.' They don't understand that I'm now spending more time fixing AI-generated spaghetti code than I would writing it properly from scratch."
