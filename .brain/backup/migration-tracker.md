## Helper Components
- [x] Created React Spring decorator for Storybook at `.storybook/utils/spring-decorator.tsx`
- [x] Updated `.storybook/preview.tsx` to include the spring decorator

## Known Issues
1. TypeScript errors with animated components - Using workarounds where needed
2. Need to properly type animated components with generics when attaching styles directly
3. Resolved PageTemplate component TypeScript issues by creating a properly typed AnimatedDiv component with correct Interpolation typing

## Migration Strategy
1. Focus on most visible animations first
2. Use simpler CSS transitions for minor animations
3. Handle complex enter/exit animations with React Spring
4. Add proper typings for all animated components 

## Testing Results
- ✅ All components migrated so far have been verified to work correctly in Storybook
- ✅ Button hover animations working properly with React Spring
- ✅ Bio section components (BioIntro, FeaturedMedia, TechnicalExpertise) rendering correctly with animations
- ✅ FeatureGrid using React Spring's useTrail for staggered card animations
