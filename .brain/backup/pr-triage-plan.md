# PR Triage and Split Plan (Simplified)

## Overview
This document outlines the simplified strategy for breaking up our large-scale refactoring PR into smaller, more focused PRs. By recognizing that React Spring migration is unnecessary if we downgrade to React 18, we can drastically simplify our approach.

## Current Challenges
- Massive PR with multiple concerns mixed together
- React 19 to 18 migration issues
- Unnecessary React Spring refactoring causing widespread style issues
- GitHub Projects feature implementation tangled with other changes
- Route updates and port conflicts

## Simplified PR Split Strategy

### PR 1: Core React Downgrade (React 19 to 18)
**Focus:** Revert to React 18 compatibility

**Changes to Include:**
- Update package.json dependencies (React 18.2.0, associated packages)
- Restore Framer Motion 10.x.x (compatible with React 18)
- Remove React Spring migration code (no longer needed)
- Fix type definitions affected by the React version change
- Adjust any code using React 19-specific features

**Testing Strategy:**
- Verify the application builds and starts correctly
- Run unit tests to ensure basic functionality
- Manual testing of critical application paths
- Check animations work properly with Framer Motion

### PR 2: Route System Updates and Port Fixes
**Focus:** Fixing route issues and port conflicts

**Changes to Include:**
- Fix port conflicts and "address already in use" errors
- Update redirects from root path
- Fix broken navigation links
- Add proper error handling for routes
- Implement port fallback mechanism

**Testing Strategy:**
- Test each route for proper rendering
- Verify proper navigation between pages
- Check for correct URL patterns in address bar
- Test port conflict resolution

### PR 3: GitHub Projects Feature Implementation
**Focus:** Isolated implementation of the GitHub Projects feature

**Changes to Include:**
- New components specific to GitHub Projects
- API integration for GitHub data
- UI for displaying repositories, stars, etc.
- Any new routes specific to this feature

**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests for new components
- Integration tests with GitHub API
- Manual testing of the feature workflow
- Verify correct display of repository data

## Dependency Order and Strategy

### Recommended Merge Order:
1. PR 1: React 18 Downgrade (foundation for other PRs)
2. PR 2: Route System Updates (fixes critical navigation issues)
3. PR 3: GitHub Projects Feature (adds new functionality)

### Strategy for Handling Conflicts:
1. Create clean feature branches from the main branch after each PR merge
2. Rebase feature branches frequently to incorporate main branch changes
3. Use git cherry-pick for complex changes that need to be preserved
4. Document any intentional style or behavior changes

## Style Changes Management

### Reverting Problematic Style Changes:
- Using the React 18 downgrade should naturally undo many problematic style changes
- Revert any additional style changes that were only needed for React Spring
- Document in PR which style regressions are being fixed

### Preserving Valuable Style Improvements:
- Document which style changes should be kept as improvements
- Isolate these in the PRs where they're most relevant
- Consider creating a separate "style cleanup" PR if needed after the core fixes

## Implementation Tasks

### Preparation Phase:
- [ ] Create a branch from main for React 18 downgrade
- [ ] Create a branch for route system updates
- [ ] Create a feature branch for GitHub Projects

### Documentation Tasks:
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md for each PR
- [ ] Document breaking changes or behavior differences
- [ ] Update version numbers following semantic versioning

### Port Conflict Resolution:
- [ ] Identify processes using port 4000
- [ ] Implement port fallback mechanism or kill conflicting processes
- [ ] Add port utility to find available ports

## Next Steps
1. Begin with the React 18 downgrade branch
2. Update package.json and resolve immediate compatibility issues
3. Implement a basic test suite to verify application functionality
4. Prepare the first PR for review
