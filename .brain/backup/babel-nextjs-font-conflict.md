# Resolving Conflicts Between Babel and Next.js Font System

## The Issue

When using Next.js with a custom Babel configuration (`.babelrc`), you may encounter the following error when trying to use the `next/font` system:

```
Syntax error: "next/font" requires SWC although Babel is being used due to a custom babel config being present.

```

This error occurs because:

1. Next.js's font system (`next/font`) requires the SWC compiler
2. When a custom Babel configuration is present (`.babelrc`), Next.js disables SWC and uses Babel instead
3. This creates an incompatibility between the font system and the compilation process

## The Conflict

In our project, we faced a choice between:

1. **Using a custom Babel configuration** for styled-components, which would break the font system
2. **Using Next.js's built-in styled-components support** via the SWC compiler, which would allow the font system to work

## Our Solution

We chose to use Next.js's built-in styled-components support for the following reasons:

1. **Compatibility with `next/font`** - This allows us to use Next.js's optimized font loading system
2. **Better performance** - SWC is faster than Babel for compilation
3. **Simpler configuration** - Fewer configuration files to maintain

To implement this solution, we:

1. Removed the `.babelrc` file
2. Kept the `compiler.styledComponents: true` setting in `next.config.ts`

## Next.js Built-in Styled Components Support

Next.js provides built-in support for styled-components through its SWC compiler. This is configured in `next.config.ts`:

```javascript
const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  compiler: {
    styledComponents: true,
  },
};
```

This configuration enables the following features:

1. Server-side rendering of styled-components
2. Automatic vendor prefixing
3. Smaller bundle size
4. Faster compilation

## Alternative Solutions

If you need to keep your custom Babel configuration, you could:

1. **Use a different font loading approach** instead of `next/font`
2. **Split your project** into separate parts, with fonts in a part that doesn't use Babel
3. **Use a different styling solution** that doesn't require Babel configuration
