Mark,deGroat,Rearc,Senior Software Engineer,"Dave is truly a triple threat.  He writes efficient and clever code, is an online marketing wiz and on top of that is also a talented composer.  He combines these skills eloquently in the projects he's shown me, and is truly a generalist who isn't afraid to specialize in the things he is passionate about.  I want to highlight Dave's creative abilities because they extend far beyond his compositional work into his software.  Whenever I needed an innovative solution to a problem I was experiencing, Dave was my go to resource.  He can quickly shift his perspective when faced with a challenge and this allows him to avoid tunnel vision while searching for a solution.  He's also a talented researcher and a true child of the internet, which meant he was always up to date on the latest and greatest ways of developing for the web.  I look forward to collaborating with Dave again in the future, and know that any company would be lucky to have this individual on their team.  Beyond this he's also a joy to be around,  Dave is what I would refer to as a ""good soul"".","06/29/17, 03:01 PM",VISIBLE
Robbie,Weber,Mage Hand,Founder | Full Stack Engineer,"One of Dave's biggest assets is his ability to see beyond the immediate problems. His vision and forward thinking is unlike anyone else I've ever encountered. That coupled with his extreme work ethic make Dave one of the greatest asset any team can acquire. Dave was always one who desired and succeeded at exceeding any challenges given him.   He and I had the privilege to collaborate on a website that mimics the functionality of Reddit but seeded with satirical web content. Every hurdle we encountered Dave was able to persevere through. We rubber duckied for as long as was needed for the challenge to be overcome.   Dave is not only inspiring to work with, but he's also will do what it takes to get the job done.

Peter,Kim,PayPal,Software Engineer,I was given an opportunity to work with David on our first project for school and the amount of creativity and ambitiousness he has is very refreshing. Sometimes it's easy to see your limitations and hold back what you want to get done but David doesn't let such things get in the way. He works very hard and expects his work to be great quality. He was a pleasure to work with and his work ethic is inspiring. We had a great time making our first project and it was something that seemed impossible at the time but his ability to keep going until the very end allowed us to finish successfully. I would highly recommend David as I've experienced David's personality and work ethic first hand.,"06/27/17, 09:38 PM",VISIBLE
Sammy,Steiner,Nava,Senior Software Engineer,"I had the opportunity to collaborate with David on a brainstorming application with Rails on the backend and vanilla Javascript on the front end. I was really impressed with David's ability to really quickly design the complex user interactions and high def wireframes in a way that was easy to understand and also really detailed. David was also really great at finding and implementing javascript libraries in our project to quickly build out the functionality of our application, including adding a complex library to manipulate and move dom elements by dragging and dropping.  David is really great to work with and is a very creative problem solver. I would look forward to any opportunity to collaborate with him again in the future.","06/27/17, 04:14 PM",VISIBLE
Charlie,Stopek,DigiDems,DigiDems Organizer,"David is one of the hardest workers I came across at Flatiron School.  He loved his work and had big ideas about projects to create.  When it came to understanding concepts he would focus on learning them until he truly grasped the idea.  We would engage in deep conversations about the world and our perceptions of it, and thus how we could change it through coding.  He inspired me to work harder and smarter.  If I ever was putting together a team for a project, David would be at the top of my list for his work ethic alone. I know from the short time that I have known him, he will be a friend for life.  I am sure I can count on him to provide constructive feedback and stimulating ideas for any issues I have in life, coding or even the coding of my life!","06/27/17, 03:58 PM",VISIBLE
Ethan,Ryan,The Corcoran Group,Frontend Engineer,"Dave's passion for coding knows no bounds. This guy knows how to build apps and how to solve problems with code. Perhaps more importantly, he loves it. He loves the challenge of creating something new, and he has the intelligence, skill, and drive to do just that, day in and day out.  It's no surprise that Dave has a background in music, as he has a deep appreciation for the unseen world, and how a small thing, like a musical note, or a local variable, can be shaped into a larger pattern to create something beautiful.  Anyone lucky enough to work with Dave will benefit from his enthusiasm, focus, and strong work ethic, in addition to his laid-back demeanor and excellent sense of humor. Dave is a highly skilled programmer who would be a huge asset to any team.","06/27/17, 02:51 PM",VISIBLE
Naz,Khan,Instagram,Senior Software Engineer,"During the 4 months Dave and I were students together at the Flatiron School, he showed me how far talent, passion, and sheer will can take you. This is a man who knows how to find and solve problems we as users encounter on a daily basis when it comes to interacting with web applications. Every one of his projects were meticulously thought out to solve a problem in the real world. Whether it be to increase productivity through a task managing tool or to address user experience concerns in an app we all have on our phone by creating his own iteration, Dave's imagination and focus will take him very far. I still do not understand how he is able to code for hours on end without taking a break or getting distracted. He is an asset to any company or organization that snatches him up.   Unfortunately we were never able to collaborate on a project, but I am sure sometime down the road we will make it happen. It was a privilege to learn from and alongside him.","06/27/17, 04:33 AM",VISIBLE
Peter,Chicarielli,SchiffGold LLC,Creative Developer,"Dave is a creative force, unlike any person I've ever seen.  His enthusiasm for code, music, and innovative breakthroughs is contagious to those around him. While many of us were struggling to learn the vast amount of information being thrown our way, Dave had the tenacity and skill to build an app that helped deal with this issue. It was just about an everyday occurrence that Dave would impress the class with some app he created, a blog he wrote, or some bit of technology he learned over the weekend. This passion comes from within him and is the exact reason he's able to continuously impress his peers and mentors.  Dave is the sort of person you want in your corner. Without a doubt in my mind, he has proven to be someone who works well beyond that which is expected of him, and has that passion for leading and inspiring others. Always a pleasure to find time to talk with Dave about some current projects or future ambitions. An incredible human being, that I am so gracious to have met.","06/27/17, 03:43 AM",VISIBLE
Jonathan L.,Karp,eMoney Advisor,Senior Sales Manager GEO Accounts (Southeast),"David is a great person to know!  I’ve had the privilege of working with David for little more than 7 months now and in that time I have known David to be a well-grounded and down to earth business partner and colleague. He is a calculated risk taker, genius marketer and realist who seems to grasp ideas holistically whilst still taking note to the acute details as our resident tech guru. I found this to be incredibly valuable in working with him, as it allows him (and for those who work with him) the ability to explore and understand nearly all possible perspectives to an idea and its numerous applications. He is an extremely motivated worker and value creator in the truest sense.","09/29/15, 11:23 PM",VISIBLE
Ariel,Fabian,Moshea CPR Labs,CEO,"I had the privilege and pleasure getting to know and work with David.  David is the kind of person that is so positive, knowledgeable and yet hungry to learn more that it is easy to extend working relationship to more personal type.  David faced a very challenging task of creating a modern marketing program from scratch for a company that didn't almost any marketing. He had to change the company culture along with the obvious workload of developing an overall marketing program.  I tried to assist David as much as I could from my area of expertise and personal experience. This collaboration opened the door to David's rich and comprehensive approach, where he managed to combine experience of his music world, visual experience, writing, and creativity, while being organized.  He also managed to engage Saturn's leading staff into work with him as a group.  David will be an asset to any company and I dare to say at any position he will choose to do.  I certainly hope that our professional ways will cross again.","09/28/15, 10:44 PM",VISIBLE
George,Pappas,Saturn Business Systems,VP of Sales,"Saturn made the decision several years ago to get more creative on the marketing side and hired Dave.

I will miss working with Dave and his creative mindset.","09/28/15, 01:21 PM",VISIBLE

Angela,Velasquez,The Kitty Bodega,Owner,"Although I worked with David for a stunted period of time, his work ethic and intense focus made a strong impression on me. He didn't waste one minute of time questioning what he was doing or burdening himself with any kind of mental defeat. Instead he grew quicker and fast than anyone on my sales floor and while he did that, he also quickly began to contribute and put into place measures that would make the entire team more successful.
