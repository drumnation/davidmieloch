These solutions transformed my co-parenting experience so dramatically that I started building my own platform.   But realizing you're already dominating this space, I'd much rather join forces and lead development of these premium features for you.  Would you be open to a 15-minute call to see how I could transform OFW from a messaging platform into an intelligent co-parenting ally - one that helps draft messages, mediates conflicts, spots potential issues, and maybe even provides legal insights?  Best, Dave  P.S. Happy to demo the interactive dashboards and graphs I built showing OFW communication patterns and conflict trends - all from my existing OFW message data.",INBOX,No

The amount of effort it takes to build them from the outside is so much higher than if you built them.    Is there anybody who would listen to my ideas?  The amount of pain you could help solve for people would undeniably increase your upsells. I‚Äôm about to try and sync your database to my own just so I can implement these features in my own messaging app.  Thank you. I hope you read this.",INBOX,No

As far as I could tell you were one of the most valuable engineers at the company.¬† Not only did you have your hands deep in R&D, familiar with new tech, but you were involved with many of the product lines across the board. You had a long tenure which gave you great insights into where we were to help chart paths for the future.¬† I watched you overachieve and constantly push into areas and concerns that were being overlooked and that is hugely valuable.¬† You were one of the coolest heads helping to broker understanding between the DC team and Bill and I'm sure a reason why things are running smoother now and Bill is trying to be more empathetic to the emotional needs of the dev team lately.  For what it's worth I've worked at many startups where they shut off all my communication tools upon leaving or layoff and they were much smaller than Scala. It's to stop you from messaging everybody in the company and telling them what you told me or posting an angry rant in public channels that could hurt morale. They know it's a shitty thing to do and are looking to limit the damage it could have to the rest of the teams you interfaced with.¬†  I'm going through a lot right now myself.¬† For the past year almost I've been going through a really crazy divorce with an ex that has serious mental health issues and went the route of trying to destroy me and take the kids out of state.¬† I've largely defended against this, but it's certainly taken a toll on my work.¬† If they are eliminating positions and laying people off I can't imagine I'm immune.¬† I'm also not the lowest paid person on the team. Mark knows I've been struggling with this and it doesn't seem like they showed a whole lot of care around the timing with you being that you just had surgery. Sorry to hear you are still in pain.¬†¬†  I've never heard of an engineer being laid off, certainly not one as decorated as you, that wasn't given severance... With all the legal bills I have right now and child support,¬† being laid off without severance would be beyond terrible for me.¬†¬†  This kind of move really just strikes fear into the hearts of everyone.¬† Your performance reviews were solid I'm sure and you were contributing, you were one of the few that wasn't actually quiet quitting due to all the bs, but then out of the blue they decided to eliminate your position.¬† The holidays are a difficult time of year to find a new job due to¬† time with family and financial obligations and nobody wants to job search without a job. Although I'm sure you will land on your feet with the kind of experience and connections I'm sure you've made over the years.¬† It's hard for me to assume that Scala would make much of a dent in whatever financial problems it's having just removing one engineer regardless of your salary.¬† Difficult not to see this as a signal of greater instability.  I'm not really in a good place to job search myself, but letting you go, for the reasons and the way they did it, is a red flag I almost can't ignore.¬† Up until now I was surfing from one corporate mess to another and this has been the longest I've planted somewhere.¬† The stress and distraction of my divorce has made putting my full attention into something new untenable and still sort of is at the moment.¬† This just adds a whole new front for me to worry about.¬† Ugh...  I'm really sorry to see you go.¬† You were one of the smartest and most useful people I have worked with at Scala. I echo your sentiments about all the others who don't do much and sometimes seem to hinder progress more than advance it. Noting your head butting with Govind the other day around titles when you were just facilitating a meeting to get things done. It definitely does not feel good to lose one of the sanest people both knowledgable about the technical and people issues at the company.¬† You will be sorely missed and I can't imagine I'll be the only engineer gravely concerned for their own safety after watching what they did to you.¬†  If you are interested I can put you in touch with a great recruiter if you don't have someone you have a relationship with and I also have some family with connections at Vanguard if that's a place you think you might want to go. Stable but I know not the most cutting edge. Keep in touch and let me know how it goes for you.  davidmieloch@gmail.com 610-716-4984",INBOX,No

I enjoyed getting to work with you as well, and I am just sorry it has been under less than ideal conditions and circumstances for everyone for so long. I am sorry I couldn't finish talking with you or anyone for that matter earlier today when Slack got cut off right after email. Like who does that at such a small company?¬†  Sorry I am still very angry at the moment hours later at nearly 1:30am. Mark and I were both blindsided, apparently it came down literally to the salary I commanded and EARNED (despite the bullshit ""restructuring has eliminated my position"" excuse I got from Matt today) and yet you still have clueless turds like Aita and Stephen Booth - clueless total fucksheads.   I have been through this before unfortunately back in 2015, and I know exactly what I am worth based on my experience, capabilities and can command from my job history and experience, and from all the time I put in over the past 6 years here alone to build the services department and then transition to R&D to try and help with our Products. Scala is simply behind in payments across the board and floundering, cant get inventory and clearly fine with attrition and now outright drastic cuts. I literally am one of the only people who was been working on trying to establish a solid foundation for the future of the company since the day I walked in in 2016, and yet Khalif or others recently hired who have done literally NOTHING for months remain - its all money with zero respect and my salary made me a target. unbelieveable, but I have seen this before they think people are expendable, when they are actually your greatest assets.  Scala is a complete joke now - you guys have never even really seen even a small percentage of what I am truly capable of, or what I have done for this company over the past 6 years, and to be unceremoniously simply shut off in the middle of the afternoon literally while I am recovering from major surgery last week (why I was out Wed, Thursday and Friday, I had bi-lateral inguinal hernia repair and am still in a ton of pain but worked all day today) and put in a full solid day of work, to then have ZERO notice, just shut down my email, slack, etc. like I am some sort of scumbag or something that can't be trusted, when I literally had the keys to every single GitHub repo of our entire product lines, infuriates me to no end. Zero respect. This is the company you are employed by.  In any case, despite my grievance, I definitely would be happy to stay in touch, and I wish we could have had more engagement across the board and a more positive experience for you and the rest of the guys working on DC, as it truly is the future of the company. It probably would be easier to convey my thoughts and just follow up with you directly. My cell is 215.901.3142 thats mine and will always follow me and my personal email is rhall@impossibilities.com - I'll drop you a note tomorrow, maybe we can connect when you have some time to chat - I dont have to hold anything back at this point. Probably easier to chat than back and forth here or email. Would be happy to do so.   My only advice, please dont do anything rash in response to my treatment, you are a talented guy with a lot of potential - keep your job as long as you can, I know you have a lot going on, so please don't let what happened to me impact your decisions, but do keep in mind this should be a huge red flag that someone literally working on the future of the company and was passionate about it, is dismissed simply over my salary without even Kevin or Chris reaching out to me to even discuss discuss options, and instead took the chickenshit route of not even speaking to me, and instead having Matt Cadwell a completely useless corporate tool deliver the message - he wanted Mark to tell me and I interrupted Mark asks said to him and Matt: ""Mark, I know where you and I stand and my work speaks for it - I want Matt to convey whatever message has been handed down since they cant be bothered to speak to me directly, and I told him him on the phone he is a fuckhead and the entire thing is horseshit - all of this is par for the course. Chris and Kevin dont seem to realize, its not their brand, its not the the products, its definitely not the cheap ass Chinese bullshit bottom of the barrel hardware or any of our outdated intellectual property - its the PEOPLE that make the company - I know this from running my own company for over a decade and my family company since the 1920's. Incredibly myopic and disrespectful and just plain stupid.   ¬†Sorry, clearly I am pretty livid still at the moment regarding everything including the timing and the fact that ALL the feedback from Mark has been positive. ¬†Well connect and chat - again, thank you or being kind enough to reach out and I'll hit you up tomorrow when I can. ¬†Good luck with everything Dave, I feel for you guys. I would suggest if you aren't already looking for another jobs at this point, make sure you have good documentation on what you have done here, and do as much as you can to be prepared because no one is getting severance, only any remaining vacation time. I'm not even getting a bonus I am entitled too for the past year of efforts, nor any of the money I have promised in writing for work I did from day one, on a variety of clients and projects, its been excuses after excuses and I have the documents to back it up. Take care of yourself and stay on your toes. Good luck with everything and well talk soon. All the best to you Dave!",INBOX,No

We're just starting a search to add talented engineers to join our new web team to take on a brand new initiative for us that is critical for our growth in 2021 - building a web portal for travel!  For reference, Hopper started as a travel app. We did about $1B in sales last year and are weathering the COVID storm better than one would expect. We just raised $170M and in the past year have tripled our valuation to almost $2B while growing our revenues by 100%! We owe our success, in large part, to a proprietary suite of data-driven and risk-based financial services that we have developed that complement a customer's trip-purchasing experience. One example is Price Freeze, where our customers are able to purchase a financial option in the app to lock in any price that they see, on any item, for as short as 1 hour or as long as 21 days with Hopper taking the risk on the other side of the trade.  Now we're laying the groundwork to expand from an app to a web product and adding great people to our team who can help us compete with the travel giants.  Would you like to connect and discuss possibilities? Thanks!  Dima Rudov Head of Hopper Web",INBOX,No

I made my own serializers because it allowed me to further control what gets sent to the view via json as well as allowing me to build on the relationships to make it cleaner and simpler. The front end it built with react and redux. I‚Äôve got 2 containers one responsible for displaying ‚Äúcharacter cards‚Äù basically like an index view. The other responsible for holding a collection of everything else. Stats,spells, attacks, items each one is a collection of components responsible for displaying something. I tried to use separation of concerns for the display components however some of them have render other components that are responsible for performing the update or a task of some form. I used forms built write into this show page to add new things to each character. And I built my own functions to make each and every piece editable. ",INBOX,No

If the job is located in Philly you still have to pay the Philly tax. Both your home and the job need to be outside the city.  I was connected to Comcast through a recruiter but never ended up interviewing. I was worried about being furloughed since they mostly hire contractors. I'm glad I decided against it could have lost my job right away after covid.   The biggest companies around here are Comcast and Vanguard, but there are lots of smaller companies worth working for around here too. You just need to get connected to the recruiter scene down here.    I randomly got called in NYC for my last job and worked remote from Manhattan to Conshohoken, PA. Wasn't really sure what was around. After I moved was able to get connected to different recruiters through coworkers and was able to branch out and find more positions. I was surprised how much react work there was.  You will likely end up being full stack at any smaller company or team. The only time where title really limits you is at a big company where there are enough people to cover each piece. Otherwise you'll always be doing a bit of both.   At my current job everybody is a full stack dev but we each lean one way or the other. After flatiron you should be leaning front as backend folks have likely not been introduced to alot of the react and redux patterns.   What are your flatiron projects?  ",INBOX,No

I also have only seen one company using rails (Amazon believe it or not) my brother works in hr there and is friends with the lead software engineer in the Middletown de location. As you were saying they are also working on moving away. I am definitely willing to do front end and I really like react however I would prefer full stack.   My goal is actually to also live in the suburbs and work in Philly.  Currently I have an application in for booksource for an elevate program they have the recruiter I am working with works with Comcast specifically. They are not planning to make any moves until this corona thing dies down.

Lots of react jobs out here. I'm full stack but many companies are light in serious frontend developers right now (as well as QAE and DevOps). All the good programmers on staff were backend and the backend guys could get away with making a simple frontend, writing tests, and setting up their own DevOps... But it's just too much now and the back end focused guys are putting up the white flag. I'm seeings this pattern again and again. Both this job and my last I came in to refactor and rewrite a front end that a back end engineer wrote.  The patterns are different and they always trying to make MVC happen inside the V (react) layer of the project. That said, I've already worked on the backend and implemented DevOps processes so despite the title I'm not relegated to frontend.  The MERN stack is hot. I see it being used everywhere. Rails was great to learn at flatiron but besides a legacy project I did at my first job, I haven't worked on a single greenfield project that uses rails. Anytime I see a company hiring for rails it's because they have some ancient dying system that the current lead decided to escape from and now they need someone new... sounds fun right? These days seems like everyone uses node. If you are savvy in JavaScript it just makes more sense to use that anyway. Less context switching between languages.  Does not hurt to know some MongoDB and GraphQL. Know Redux, most companies use it and knowing good state management practices is just as important as knowing how to build components with React.  I moved to the Philly burbs. Seems like there were more jobs in the city but after living in Manhattan I didn't want to pay the Philly taxes. 4 days after I started my current job they sent us all home for Corona and have been working from home since.

They're willing to look at mid-senior people or even junior folks.  They even said if someone did not have a ton of React experience specifically, they'd be willing to hire a strong JS UI Developer that wanted to learn it for one of their roles.  To be honest, they're one of the hottest firms in the area right now and I would love to tell you about them.

I am reaching out because I am currently exploring talent in the NYC area who may be interested in learning more about a Senior Back-end Developer role with a company called Quip.   Not sure if you have heard of them or not? But essentially, they have a line of dental related products, ranging all the way from physical electric tooth brushes (state of the art, very tech driven) all the way to dental insurance and practice locators. For their toothbrushes, they offer a first of its kind ""brush-head refill subscription"" where they send new brush-heads every month at a low price.   This role would be at their HQ, which has awesome views of the Manhattan Bridge, a WiFi enabled roof where they encourage work to be done out of, and a dog-friendly office (and more).   They were recently featured by Time Magazine as one of the top 25 Best Inventions of 2016 (really though, check out their electronic tooth-brushes, they are so damn cool. Def going to knock Sonicare out of the water). And also just secured a 2nd round of funding. Some of the other perks consist of 401k contribution, fully covered insurance, open vacation policy, your own provided Quip subscription, and commuter benefits. They pay competitively as well.   Technically, they want this person to have deep experience designing and engineering APIs, and integrating with 3rd party APIs. You will also be building out internal production systems, architectures, tools, and testing systems. This is a Ruby on Rails back-end, and they also have some Docker and Kubernetes in their stack!

I am currently working on an incredible opportunity based out of NJ for a Hubspot and Demand Gen manager for an urgently hiring opportunity with a young, forward thinking organization looking to invest in a passionate MarTech go-getter. This position is with a client of mine who is growing and is looking for someone eager to grow along with them - this position is meant to grow from Manager to Director and beyond as this is the first hire of many into the MarTech team. This person will be laying the foundation for future team hires and will be a decision maker going forward as this person will be overseeing the MarTech team once hired.  Due to the urgency of this position, we are looking for someone who is open to working with them on a short term contract-to-hire so that we can get this person in immediately and begin the growth into director right away.

Being able to fuse realistic human-like conversation design (‚Äúcharacter‚Äù) and NLP/ML with the ubiquity of SMS/MMS (and RCS/Business Chat soon) is why we get out of bed in the morning as engineers at OM.  It‚Äôs also nice that goal-oriented conversations are like little conversion funnels, which makes for deeply meaningful metrics. If you‚Äôre into analytics, this is the lifeblood of our prioritization and decision making so there is a lot of interesting and impactful stuff to do there.  If you‚Äôre into massive scaling and operations, we are currently humming along at thousands of messages per second and have a roadmap to get to millions in the next few months. We need your help to get there.  For the design-inclined, one of our major features is the conversational composer frontend with previews/canvas drawing etc. that will evolve according to what the messaging channels can support in terms of content types and interaction. Messages are personalized in different ways.  We are hooking commerce functionality into the conversations as well. Buying products this way is a lot of fun as a user. Thanks to our design, we can kick off any kind of API calls as a natural part of the conversation without adding complexity to the codebase.  Our current tooling is a mix of Python, Node, PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch, and Docker. We are exploring Go for some things and prefer smaller abstractions, less frameworks, minimal dependencies, and leveraging purpose-built components. We value orthogonality and safety as design principles. Creativity is best applied to data structures and decoupling.  We are strongly motivated by inclusiveness of all genders, faiths, origins and backgrounds and are careful about ensuring a harmonious and respectful team culture with space for every voice and safety in mutual vulnerability. We value work life balance, boundaries, and privacy as well.  The engineer will get between .05 and 1% of equity in the company and will be one of our early stage members who we hope will evolve into one of the company leaders.   Company description and Perks of working for OpenMessage (feel free to share the below with interested candidates)  OpenMessage is the world's first fully-customizable mobile messaging platform. We evolve black-and-white exchanges into vivid connections, wherever your audience may be. You can visit our site at www.openmessage.io.

Lastly, here is a link to a video that the founder of TXT Stories created for us illustrating the future of text messaging that we are creating.

It was, indeed, cool to see. They even had these Mongolian dancers do a routine during one of their songs. I never expected to see that.   You know, I'm not much of a fan of BDM, except for their last couple of albums. I only really enjoy Arch Enemy with Johan Liiva. I saw both of those bands at Ozzfest 2005 and wasn't too impressed with either. Also, I can generally be an elitist sometimes, and I think it's a shame that Michael Amott left Carcass for that. I do like Alissa White-Gluz, though, but I didn't like The Agonist. Maybe it's just me not liking Angela Gossow. I don't really know. But I do like At the Gates.

I'm definitely going to tell my boss about your company, because although we have a music library of our own that we license songs from, we're also a recording studio with producers that are great composers as well, and she (my boss) is always looking for companies for them to work with.  Ah, Russian Circles. I've listened to them and I like them. Haven't heard the others, but I'll give them a chance. Sometimes I get in that mathy mood.  As for what I've been listening to, I mostly try to catch up with new metal/hard rock albums from the year. I'm way behind. Last year I listened to probably hundreds of new metal albums as a challenge to myself, and I discovered a lot of bands along the way, like Tengger Cavalry. They're Mongolian folk metal that include throat singing and traditional Mongolian folk instruments. Pretty great stuff. Yesterday I was listening to Void of Sleep, Revenge and Tombstalker. No real theme there, just stuff I had queued. It usually has no theme. Also, the latest TSO album. Those are always fun this time of year.",INBOX,No

As a developer my wife and I have found a flaw in your system I'm sure you'd want to know about.  Being that you're the only person at Handybook on Linkedin, you're the only person I'm able to contact.  The last three times we've used your service your ratings system has proved to be irrelevant.  We chose a cleaner that was highly rated, but without warning, right before our appointment, our cleaner was switched with a cleaner with no ratings at all.  These new cleaners all three times were terrible.  My wife is pregnant and as a busy software developer and husband I'm doing a lot of cleaning and managing of the house.  These terrible cleaners come into our tiny 2 room apartment that I've kept mostly clean myself and follow your basic checklist as if they have no brain of their own with which to judge what should be cleaned.    I feel it's incredibly unfair that we book a highly rated cleaner only to be bait and switched to a brand new terrible cleaner at the last minute, and then after they barely clean the apartment, get our fee. I came home to hairballs in the kitchen and the house barely much more clean than I left it when I came home.  I realize you're not in the US and thus might not care at all, but I figured I'd reach out to a real person who cares about the company to see if you could remedy our situation, at the very least change the system which allows a chosen cleaner to be switched without our consent at the very last moment instead of offering us the ability to reschedule the highly rated cleaner.  I'd really appreciate a response, even if it's that you can't help me.  Thank you.  -Dave",INBOX,No

As mentioned in my invite, I'd like to ask for your help.    I recently started working at Woo.io, a platform that lets software developers find out if companies can give them what they want; more money, a promotion, better perks, relocation, etc. It lets you check your career options, anonymously (without the hassle of regular job hunting).   I want to prove that I can be helpful with the company's current mission - getting more beta users to try Woo.   As you are a full stack developer you would be the perfect beta user, and I am sure those in your circle could greatly benefit from using Woo as well.  Would you mind helping me by referring me to people you know of who may find it useful? (and of course, signing up yourself?)   Here is an invite-only link: www.woo.io/beta :)  Many thanks!

When we first connected I was in a curmudgeonly phase where I was trying to figure some stuff out so I'm sorry for being distant back then. The project and your work was good I just wasn't in a place to work on anything seriously.    Anyway a month or so after we last skyped I started preparing to apply for coding bootcamps. Since then I've spent the past six months or so learning to code javascript and ruby taking multiple bootcamp prep courses and recently got accepted to a reputable NYC 3 month immersive bootcamp which I'm starting next month.    I've been learning selenium and have already written a few small bots.  My first bot takes in my bootcamp prep exercise names and file names and scrapes everyone who forked those files from the school's github.  Then it extracts the html from each person's answer and returns it in the console thus helping me to put 40 different answers to the same question right next to each other :D  Working on breaking captchas now. ;-)  Anyway.  Thanks for the inspiration and I appreciate you helping to get me started. Sorry for blowing you off back there and I hope we talk soon.  -Dave",INBOX,No

As a leading digital marketing expert, your thoughts and experiences would be highly relevant for us. If you could find the time to answer the following questions, we'd really appreciate it:  1. How many different marketing channels (e.g. Adwords, Facebook, Adroll-Retargeting) do you work with? 2. Is display advertising part of your digital marketing mix? If so, do you evaluate display ads on a click or on a view through basis? 3. How do you evaluate your digital marketing performance, what attribution method (e.g last-click, first-click, position based, algorithmic) do you use? Do you work with any marketing attribution tool?  I would be happy to share our preliminary research results, if you are interested. We could also have a brief call to exchange experiences and thoughts regarding marketing attribution in general.  Many thanks, J√°nos",INBOX,No

How this would work is a college would purchase a license for the software and every teacher would be given a teacher account and every student given a student account.  At the beginning of the semester all of the composition students would create projects to work on with their private teacher.  You would want to use this so that you could extend your ability to discuss the student's compositions outside of the classroom to make more time for more important in-person discussions.  You'd want to use this to keep a clear history of all revisions on the composition and all related discussions. (Dr. Hanning has us had us keep a lesson log book...this is that for composition)  Right now the closest thing to this tool is SoundCloud, but soundcloud is not designed to do the task of serious collaboration about music. SoundCloud is designed to say ""YEAH! AWESOME!"" and not have a discussion about a part in a composition.  Just to be clear everything I sent you was for Advertising. The software helps a creative director at an advertising company do his job better. The process of collecting demos, paying demo fees, choosing a winning composer, getting licensing docs, etc... is a huge hassle without a tool designed to put everything in the same place and help you talk digitally about music.  I'm getting feedback from other musicians and composers because I think this could help in a college setting. If i get enough positive feedback from WCU professors and friends, I will recommend that we develop a new version of this software specifically designed for colleges. It will have more features that are even better targeted to a college environment and all the language in the software will change to be appropriate.  Does that make any better sense?  This arose originally from me wanting to post the latest mixes of my band's album online and have a discussion. I tried out SoundCloud for this and it was ultimately too confusing for our engineer to simply read down the list of comments, implement the fixes to the recording, and mark them as complete.    - Contextual comments based on time - Threaded comments (like an email or forum thread) - File Storage and Version Control  The tool is best suited for anyone with a high volume of original compositions/tracks to manage: like a recording studio, music publisher, music label, advertising agency, video production studio, video game developer, television studio, or composition professor.  Keep the feedback coming, if you don't get it then it's a sign that I'm explaining it poorly or it's something that isn't wanted/needed.  Thanks Dude. ",INBOX,No

Jon was excellent on camera and could get a perfect read through of a script in 10 minutes or so.  He was always on the phone banging out calls and thinking outside of the box for new ways to reach clients.  This led to a very successful video campaign where inbound requests for meetings came in faster than we could handle them all.      I was particularly impressed by Jon&#39;s ability to handle tough internal politics with a smile and to always stay positive during adversity.

I mean what I said.  Hope it makes you look good :)    Shoot one back if you have some nice stuff to say.    Thanks,  David  ""I worked directly with Brent for the past 6 months laying the foundation for digital transformation at Saturn.  We were very much behind in all the ways that partners are lagging behind the times today and Brent was instrumental in pulling us out of the mud.  He was patient and did well battling our internal culture, offering solid strategies to help us find footing in the new digital economy.  Six months later our value proposition is much stronger, we're seeing real opportunities to grow, and the chaos of the modern world is starting to make a little bit more sense.      As the Marketing Manager at Saturn, this process was absolutely crucial because having a unique value proposition is the required DNA for any future campaign.  This DNA was just too hard to construct by ourselves. We needed an unbiased 3rd party with cutting edge ideas to help move us forward and push us past our own internal obstacles. We've got some really great offerings to provide to our customers now and morale at Saturn has been on the rise.  """,INBOX,No

Rain King is like $12K per year.  You'd have to devote a budget of maybe $500 a month towards ads, maybe more.  You'd need to hiring a marketing person again and a web developer on contract.     Yaakov and Steve (if he's still there) blocked every form of progress possible.     The problem is that Yaakov will never see the new paradigm and will never invest his remaining money in the right places.  Yes these things are expensive, but so is rent, and you need an office to run a business.  He just refuses to pay for new things that he historically didn't need.    The thing is many mature companies are having problems and trying to adapt right now, but Graphnet isn't even trying.     He's also mentally ill... which makes it difficult to run a company. lol.

You get a more sophisticated (and more expensive) lead tool like Rainking.  This way you get right to the meat.  They have researchers that call the clients and interview them about what their problems are, what hardware they have, and what they are looking to buy in the next 6-12 months.  Then you coordinate landing pages, an email blast to the client, with cold call follow up.    This allows you to make far less calls because of better quality leads, since there is more information about the client so the call isn't quite so cold and you are getting people who are potentially interested.    It's about buying sophisticated tools to cut through the enormous amount of work you'd have to do randomly calling the wrong people all day.    Get people to contact you via the web + cold call the right people using the best information possible so you don't waste your time.      The same problems are happening everywhere.  It just depends on how willing the company is to adapt and spend lots of money on things that didn't used to be necessary.  Marketing, Marketing Automation Tools, Web Development, Quality Lead System, etc...    This has been my experience so far.    -Dave    ",INBOX,No

In a nutshell, I am bringing out a group of 45 senior ‚Äúbig data‚Äù decision-makers (pasted a few at the bottom) to Greenbrier, West Virginia, to meet with and evaluate external solutions. I‚Äôve strategically sourced them to be active buyers, and over 65% of them have told me that they are planning on investing in external enterprise bi/analytics/consulting services and solutions over the next 3-12 months. I thought this might be a great opportunity to work together to help you win new business, as based on my research and word-of-mouth, this firm is best-in-breed in this space. Additionally, the executives I am working with haven‚Äôt brought you up as a vendor they‚Äôve worked with before or currently.     Can you and I speak about this? It may or may not be a good fit, but it could be an opportunity worth exploring if you‚Äôre looking to get in front of very proactive buyers to close out your Q1 sales efforts on a high note.

In the future when the top down hierarchical business model dies the prevalent model will be appropriate scale (global perspectives) meaning that companies will inflate their numbers with contractors when they need them instead of establishing huge repositories of employees.  So how does one get hired in a freelancer world? You need have a resume with some good experience and lots of people who will attest to your value...much like buying a product on amazon.com....humans are becoming amazon.com products.  Building up your profile now little by little I think could prove to be very important someday.  When people all of a sudden realize that this modern form of a resume that is interactive and holds far more information than a normal paper sheet is the way to go they will be shit out of luck because you can't build a huge repository of testimonials over night.  These testimonials are like your ""reviews"" if you were an amazon.com product.  Really this is the only way a complete stranger over the internet will have the confidence to hire you...same as you have the confidence to buy a product you've never seen or touched before because of the information presented online.    My 2 cents.  Take it or leave it.  Felt you would be a good candidate for this sort of networking and should get on the bus asap.     ",INBOX,No

I spent some time going over your profile and I think that your expertise is just what I'm looking for.  Datacate provides platform and infrastructure technology solutions. In response to our clients' repeated calls for a cloud services platform that provides a less complicated and costly alternative to AWS, Azure and IBM, we've recently introduced the Datacate cloud services portal. Datacate's approach is to provide a cloud services platform that combines multiple services that a typical company would require, so that they can all be managed in a single pane of glass. Of course we have compute and storage, but we also have content delivery, BaaS and server monitoring all available via the same platform, with more services to be added soon.  Would you be interested in test-driving our new cloud services platform? I'd give you a 30-day pass to try out some features and deployments at no cost to you; you tell me what you like and don't like about it, rate the value, things of that nature. There's no obligation, but if you find the services to be useful, I'd gladly extend some persistent discounts to you as my thanks for your participation. I can give you an overview of the system first via a live web demonstration - in that way you can take a look before deciding if you want to participate in the test-drive.  Let me know what you think. Thanks for your time, I look forward to hearing back from you!  Best, Ed",ARCHIVE,No

I wrote a lot about retail (grocery) and tech for Retail leader from Progressive Grocer. I did some financial for GE for a project that hasn't gone live but used SEO a great deal. I also was the US blogger for Skype for a year and a half. You can check out my credentials in LinkedIn. I am looking for some ongoing gigs that I can count on rather than the hit-and-miss of freelance magazine articles. Not sure I fit your mix. But I figured I could ask. Pay? Always what the market will bear. During the boom that was $3+ per word. Now it may be $1.50 per word. A project basis may be a better arrangement. In any case, I am happy to chat.
