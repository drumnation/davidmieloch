I'm working with an agent that uses a set of rules called `@.cursorrules` to determine its behavior. I need help improving the agent's behavior in a specific area.

I will describe a specific situation I've observed or a desired behavior I want to implement. Based on this information, I want you to determine what needs to change in the `@.cursorrules` and then **generate the updated rules**.

You need to determine which of the following scenarios applies to the situation I describe:

1.  **Existing Rule Not Followed:** A rule exists that *should* handle this situation, but it's not working as expected. You'll need to analyze the existing `@.cursorrules`, identify the failing rule, diagnose the reason for the failure, and generate a corrected rule.
2.  **No Rule Yet (New Behavior Desired):** There's no existing rule for this specific situation. You'll need to understand the desired behavior, formulate the logic for a new rule, and generate the rule.
3.  **Undesired Behavior (Stop Something from Happening):** The agent is currently doing something I *don't* want it to do. You'll need to understand the undesired behavior, potentially analyze existing rules to see what might be causing it, and generate a rule (or modify an existing one) to prevent it.
4.  **Required Behavior (Make Something Always Happen):** I want to enforce a specific behavior, ensuring it *always* happens under the right conditions. You need to understand this required behavior and generate a rule to enforce it.

**To help you diagnose the problem and generate the correct rules, I can provide the following:**

*   The current set of `@.cursorrules` (or relevant portions).
*   Specific examples of input data, the agent's current output, and the desired output.
*   Details about the format of the data available to the agent.
*   Descriptions of the desired or undesired behavior.

**Your task is to:**

1.  **Ask clarifying questions** to understand the situation and determine which scenario applies.
2.  **Analyze** the provided information (existing rules, examples, etc.).
3.  **Generate updated or new `@.cursorrules`** that address the problem.
4.  **Output the new rules directly.**

I will now describe the specific situation I need help with.
