# Resolving Turbopack and Babel Conflicts in Next.js

## The Issue

When using Next.js with Turbopack (a new JavaScript bundler designed to replace Webpack), you may encounter the following error:

```
тип You are using configuration and/or tools that are not yet
supported by Next.js with Turbopack:
Babel detected (.babelrc)
  Babel is not yet supported. To use Turbopack at the moment,
  you'll need to remove your usage of Babel.
```

This error occurs because Turbopack is still in beta and doesn't support all the features that Webpack does, including Babel configurations.

## The Conflict

In our project, we faced a choice between:

1. **Using Turbopack** for faster development builds but losing the ability to use Babel for styled-components configuration
2. **Using Babel** for proper styled-components server-side rendering and hydration but losing the speed benefits of Turbopack

## Our Solution

We chose to prioritize proper styled-components handling over Turbopack's speed benefits for the following reasons:

1. **Hydration errors** can cause significant issues in production, including flickering content and broken styles
2. **User experience** is more important than development speed
3. **Turbopack** is still in beta and will eventually support Babel

To implement this solution, we:

1. Removed the `--turbopack` flag from the `dev` script in `package.json`
2. Kept the `.babelrc` configuration for styled-components
3. Removed the unused `postbuild` script that referenced a non-existent package
4. Installed the required `babel-loader` package:
   ```
   pnpm add --save-dev babel-loader -w
   ```

## Required Dependencies

When using Babel with Next.js, you need the following dependencies:

1. `babel-plugin-styled-components` - For proper styled-components support
2. `babel-loader` - For webpack to process files with Babel

## Alternative Solutions

If you prefer to use Turbopack, you could:

1. **Remove the `.babelrc` file** and rely solely on Next.js's built-in styled-components compiler
2. **Use CSS Modules or another styling solution** that doesn't require Babel configuration
3. **Wait for Turbopack to support Babel** in a future release

## Future Considerations

As Turbopack matures and becomes more feature-complete, we can revisit this decision. The Next.js team is actively working on improving Turbopack's compatibility with existing tools and configurations.

In the meantime, the standard Next.js development server with Webpack is still quite fast and provides all the features we need for proper styled-components handling.
