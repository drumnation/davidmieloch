# Feature Task Plan

## Feature: Home Page for Professional Portfolio

## Task: Create a compelling home page that showcases the FSBP (Full-Stack Business Person) value proposition

## Status: â­• Planning

## Last Updated: 2024-08-03

## 1. Overview

This task involves creating a compelling home page that effectively showcases the technical expertise, strategic thinking, and unique value proposition as a Full-Stack Business Person / Lean Tech Leader. The home page will serve as the main entry point for the portfolio, targeting recruiters, engineering managers, CTOs, and CEOs with clear, persona-specific messaging and visual elements that communicate both technical sophistication and strategic business acumen.

## 2. Codebase Analysis

### 2.1. Key Files & Modules

* `app/page.tsx`: Current home page component (currently redirects to enterprise-ai framework)
* `src/shared-components/organisms/Hero/Hero.tsx`: Hero component for main banner
* `src/shared-components/organisms/Hero/Hero.types.ts`: Hero component type definitions
* `src/shared-components/organisms/Hero/Hero.styles.ts`: Hero component styling
* `src/shared-components/atoms/Typography/Typography.tsx`: Typography components for consistent text styling
* `src/shared-components/organisms/Footer/Footer.tsx`: Footer component
* `src/shared-components/molecules/ContentSection/ContentSection.tsx`: Component for content sections

### 2.2. Dependencies

* `styled-components`: Used for component styling
* `Next.js`: Framework for the application
* Typography components: For consistent text styling
* Hero component: For the main banner
* Icon components: For visual elements

### 2.3. Potential Concerns

* Ensuring the home page effectively communicates the FSBP value proposition to multiple personas
* Creating a responsive design that works well on all devices
* Balancing visual appeal with performance
* [ ] Mark as addressed

## 3. Architectural Considerations

### 3.1. Selected Paradigm

* Component-Based Architecture - Utilizing existing React component structure
* [ ] Confirmed with the user

### 3.2. Selected Design Patterns

* Atomic Design Pattern - Using atoms, molecules, and organisms for UI composition
* [ ] Confirmed with the user
* Strategy Pattern - For persona-targeted content sections
* [ ] Confirmed with the user

### 3.3. Architectural Considerations & Rationale

* We'll use the existing component architecture while enhancing the home page to showcase the FSBP value proposition. The current project follows atomic design principles, which allows for modular, reusable components. This approach enables us to create a cohesive design while maintaining flexibility for different content sections targeted at specific personas (recruiters, EMs, CTOs, CEOs).
* We'll organize the home page into distinct sections, each with a clear purpose and messaging aligned with the FSBP narrative. This organized approach ensures that the page communicates effectively with different audiences.
* [ ] Confirmed with the user

## 4. Project Task List Foresight

### 4.1. Downstream Impacts

* The home page design will set visual standards for other pages
* The FSBP messaging established here will influence content throughout the site
* The home page navigation will impact user flow through the portfolio
* [ ] Reviewed and confirmed no negative impacts

### 4.2. Future-Proofing Considerations

* Design the page with content expansion in mind
* Ensure component structure allows for easy content updates
* Create clear documentation for maintaining and updating the home page
* [ ] Discussed with the user and incorporated feedback

## 5. Testing Strategy

### 5.1. Available Testing Options

* `[x] Visual Regression Tests (Storybook)`
  * Location: `.storybook`
  * Command to run all tests: `pnpm run storybook`
  * Command to run a single test: `pnpm run storybook`
* `[x] End-to-End (E2E) Tests`
  * Location: `app`
  * Command to run all tests: `pnpm run test:e2e`
  * Command to run a single test: `pnpm run test:e2e -t "Home Page"`

### 5.2. Selected Testing Approach

* We'll use Storybook for testing individual components and visual regression testing to ensure consistent styling. For functional testing, we'll implement end-to-end tests to verify the complete user flow and ensure the page functions correctly across devices and browsers.
* [ ] Confirmed testing approach aligns with project standards.
