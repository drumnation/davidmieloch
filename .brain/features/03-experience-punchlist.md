# Feature Task Plan

## Feature: Experience and Side Projects Visual Alignment

## Task: Standardize UI formatting and fix media display issues

## Status: â­• Planning

## Last Updated: 2024-08-03

## 1. Overview

This task involves aligning the visual appearance of the experiences section with the side projects section, standardizing the markdown formatting for descriptions, and fixing several UI issues with media items, particularly with sizing, button visibility, and logo display.

## 2. Codebase Analysis

### 2.1. Key Files & Modules

* `src/shared-components/sections/Experience/components/SideProjectsSection/SideProjectsSection.tsx`: Side projects display component
* `src/shared-components/sections/Experience/components/ExperienceSection/ExperienceSection.tsx`: Experience display component
* `src/shared-components/sections/Experience/components/SideProjectsSection/SideProjectsSection.constants.ts`: Side projects data
* `src/shared-components/sections/Experience/components/ExperienceSection/ExperienceSection.constants.ts`: Experience data
* `src/shared-components/sections/Experience/components/SideProjectsSection/SideProjectsSection.types.ts`: Media item type definitions

### 2.2. Dependencies

* `MarkdownRenderer`: Component used to render markdown in the side projects section
* `styled-components`: Used for styling components

### 2.3. Potential Concerns

* Ensuring consistent styling without breaking existing layouts
* Making sure media item adjustments don't cause unexpected layout shifts
* [ ] Mark as addressed

## 3. Architectural Considerations

### 3.1. Selected Paradigm

* Component-Based Architecture - Working with existing React components
* [ ] Confirmed with the user

### 3.2. Selected Design Patterns

* Atomic Design Pattern - Consistent styling and behavior across components
* [ ] Confirmed with the user
* Decorator Pattern - For enhancing media items with additional styling options
* [ ] Confirmed with the user

### 3.3. Architectural Considerations & Rationale

* We'll maintain the existing component structure while enhancing the media item rendering logic to ensure consistency. The current architecture separates concerns well, with media item rendering logic and data in distinct files. Our changes will be isolated to the rendering and styling aspects without altering the overall architecture.
* [ ] Confirmed with the user

## 4. Project Task List Foresight

### 4.1. Downstream Impacts

* Improving the visual consistency will make future feature additions more streamlined
* Standardizing markdown usage will make content updates more maintainable
* [ ] Reviewed and confirmed no negative impacts

### 4.2. Future-Proofing Considerations

* Add documentation for markdown formatting standards
* Ensure all media item types follow the same display patterns
* [ ] Discussed with the user and incorporated feedback

## 5. Testing Strategy

### 5.1. Available Testing Options

* `[ ] Visual Regression Tests (Storybook)`
    * Location: `[Storybook for Experience components]`
    * Command to run tests: `pnpm run storybook`

### 5.2. Selected Testing Approach

* Visual testing through Storybook and manual testing in the browser will be sufficient for this task since we're primarily making visual changes.
* [ ] Confirmed testing approach aligns with project standards.
