## BrainGardenOverview Alignment Tasks
- [x] Update SystemOverview diagram to include all key components from BrainGardenOverview:
  - [x] Add Prompt System component (currently missing)
  - [x] Add Structured Documentation component (currently missing)
  - [x] Include CLI Tools subsystem (missing from current diagram)
  - [x] Add Project Structure subsystem (.brain directory organization)
  - [x] Include Force Multipliers (Documentation, Testing, Git Integration)

  - [ ] Documentation structure hierarchy
- [x] Ensure consistent terminology between BrainGardenOverview and TechnicalImplementation
  - [x] Audit and align all system component names
  - [x] Use consistent metaphors and descriptions
  - [x] Match visual language with conceptual framework
- [x] Add transition elements to show relationship between:
  - [x] Conceptual framework and technical implementation
  - [x] System architecture and practical application
  - [x] Components and their real-world usage

## Additional Key Components from BrainGardenOverview
- [x] Detail "Core Teams" concept in Agent System section

## Revised Implementation Priority
1. High Priority
   - ✅ Complete section content before finalizing diagrams
   - ✅ Add practical examples of system usage
   - ✅ Incorporate Garden Metaphor consistently
   - ✅ Improve diagram readability basics (font size, contrast, spacing)
   - ✅ Update diagrams to include all key components

2. Medium Priority
   - ✅ Create additional diagrams for subsystems
   - ✅ Add basic accessibility features
   - ✅ Ensure consistent terminology
   - ✅ Create transition elements between sections

3. Low Priority
   - [ ] Refine diagram interactivity (zoom, pan)
   - [ ] Add animations
   - [ ] Implement progressive loading
   - [ ] Add advanced interaction features

## Notes
- All diagrams should follow the same visual language
- Consider breaking complex diagrams into smaller, focused views
- Each diagram should tell a clear story about its part of the system
- Consider adding sequence diagrams for complex interactions
- Add expandable nodes for drilling down into subsystems
- **IMPORTANT**: Finalize section content before investing more time in diagram refinement
