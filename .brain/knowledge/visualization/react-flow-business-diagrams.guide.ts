  corePrinciples: [
    {
      name: "Visual Hierarchy and Clarity",
      description: "Effective business diagrams establish a clear visual hierarchy that guides viewers through the information logically. This principle involves designing nodes with varying sizes, colors, and styles to indicate their importance or role in the diagram. For business whitepapers, maintain professional aesthetics by using a consistent visual language where similar elements share styling characteristics. Prioritize clarity over decoration, ensuring that every visual element serves a purpose in communicating the underlying information. Leverage React Flow's custom node capabilities to create distinctive node types that represent different business entities or concepts while maintaining visual coherence across the diagram."
    },
    {
      name: "Automatic Layout with Collision Prevention",
      description: "Manual positioning of nodes in complex business diagrams is time-consuming and error-prone. Instead, leverage automatic layout libraries like Dagre or Elkjs to efficiently organize nodes with proper spacing and no overlapping elements. This principle involves selecting the appropriate layout algorithm based on your diagram's logical structure (hierarchical, network, flowchart) and configuring it to reflect the natural flow of information. Use layout libraries that account for node dimensions and edge routing to prevent collisions between elements. For business whitepapers, prioritize layouts that emphasize clarity and logical progression, typically using top-to-bottom or left-to-right directional flows that match Western reading patterns."
    },
    {
      name: "Strategic Animation for Static Context",
      description: "While whitepapers present static content, subtle animations can significantly enhance diagram comprehension without creating distractions. This principle involves using animation judiciously to highlight relationships, draw attention to key elements, or illustrate process flows. In React Flow, implement edge animations using SVG techniques like animateMotion to show directional flow, add subtle hover effects to nodes to indicate interactivity even in static exports, and use controlled entrance animations when the diagram first renders to help viewers understand its structure incrementally. Remember that in business contexts, animations should serve an explanatory purpose rather than merely decorative—each animated element should enhance understanding of the underlying business concept."
    },
    {
      name: "Professional Color Strategies",
      description: "Color choices significantly impact both the aesthetics and functionality of business diagrams. This principle involves creating a professional, cohesive color palette that aligns with corporate branding while ensuring accessibility and semantic meaning. For business whitepapers, use color purposefully to encode information (e.g., status, category, relationship types) rather than decoratively. Implement sufficient contrast between text and background colors (minimum 4.5:1 ratio for WCAG AA compliance) for readability. Limit the color palette to 5-7 colors to maintain visual cohesion, using variations in lightness and saturation for secondary elements. Consider colorblind-friendly palettes, particularly avoiding red-green distinctions without additional visual cues. React Flow supports both light and dark themes, allowing customization through CSS variables to maintain consistent professional appearance across different viewing environments."
    },
    {
      name: "Semantic Node and Edge Design",
      description: "In business diagrams, nodes and edges should convey meaning through their visual characteristics. This principle involves designing custom nodes and edges that intuitively represent the business entities and relationships they depict. Create custom node components that incorporate recognizable iconography, meaningful shapes, and appropriate labeling to quickly communicate each element's role in the business process. Design edges with different styles (solid, dashed, dotted) and thickness to represent different relationship types or importance levels. For directional processes, use animated edges with arrow markers to clearly indicate flow direction. In professional contexts, maintain consistency in your visual language—similar business entities should have visually similar node representations to help viewers quickly comprehend the diagram's structure and meaning."
    },
    {
      name: "Scalable Performance Optimization",
      description: "Business diagrams in whitepapers must render efficiently across different devices and export cleanly to various formats. This principle involves implementing performance optimizations that ensure smooth rendering even with complex diagrams containing many nodes and edges. Optimize React Flow diagrams by implementing node virtualization for large diagrams, using appropriate memoization of node and edge components, and carefully managing state updates to prevent unnecessary re-renders. For export to whitepapers, ensure the diagram renders crisp, high-resolution outputs by configuring appropriate export settings and testing outputs at different scales. Consider implementing progressive loading strategies for particularly complex diagrams, where the basic structure appears first, followed by details, to improve perceived performance."

This guideline helps maintain visual consistency across all diagrams while streamlining development. Your design system should include reusable components, styling utilities, and documentation of usage patterns. Measure effectiveness by tracking development time reduction for new diagrams and consistency ratings from design reviews. A comprehensive design system typically reduces development time by 30-40% for subsequent diagrams and significantly improves visual consistency scores in stakeholder reviews."

      detail: "For business whitepapers, implement a systematic approach to capturing key diagram states that represent different aspects of the visualized process. This guideline improves the integration of React Flow diagrams into static documents by preserving their interactive insights. For each diagram, identify 3-5 key states (e.g., overall view, focused process paths, highlighted components) and capture high-resolution images. Combine these images with explanatory captions in the whitepaper to provide multiple perspectives on the visualized information. Measure effectiveness by tracking reader comprehension scores and time spent on diagram sections in user testing. Whitepaper sections with multiple diagram states typically show 40-60% better information retention in reader assessments compared to single-view diagrams."

      guideline: "Implement Progressive Complexity Revelation",
      detail: "Design complex business diagrams to progressively reveal information rather than overwhelming viewers with all details at once. This guideline improves comprehension by allowing readers to build mental models incrementally. For whitepapers, this means creating a sequence of diagrams that gradually introduce additional layers of detail. Implement this through a combination of interactive states in the React Flow implementation and strategic exports of different detail levels for the whitepaper. Measure effectiveness by testing comprehension rates at different exposure durations. Progressive revelation typically improves first-impression comprehension by 50-70% compared to presenting full-complexity diagrams immediately."
