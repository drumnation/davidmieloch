# Feature Task Plan

## Feature: React Spring Bug Fixes

## Task: Fix Maximum Call Stack Size Exceeded Errors in React Spring Components

## Status: ðŸŸ¡ In Progress

## Last Updated: 2023-06-02

## 1. Overview

This task addresses the widespread Maximum Call Stack Size Exceeded errors occurring in the application due to improper usage of react-spring animations. These errors manifest as infinite recursion in the SpringValue.eventObserved cycle, primarily caused by direct access to spring values through the `.get()` method in render functions. 

### Updated Strategy

After multiple attempts to fix React Spring issues through direct patching and mock implementations, we've determined that the most effective solution is a complete migration to Framer Motion. This approach will:

1. Eliminate the root cause of Maximum Call Stack Size errors by removing React Spring entirely
2. Provide a more stable animation system with better Next.js compatibility
3. Improve overall application stability and performance

## 2. Codebase Analysis

### 2.1. Key Files & Modules

* `src/utils/animations/typed-components.tsx`: Contains a problematic `springToCss` utility function that directly calls `.get()` on spring values
* `src/utils/animations/migration-helpers.tsx`: Contains another implementation of `springToCss` with the same issue
* `src/shared-components/organisms/FeaturePreview/FeaturePreview.tsx`: Example component with inline definition of a problematic `springToCss` function
* `src/shared-components/organisms/DebtAnalysis/DebtAnalysis.tsx`: Uses the imported `springToCss` function
* `src/shared-components/organisms/ImpactGrid/ImpactGrid.tsx`: Uses the imported `springToCss` function
* `src/shared-components/organisms/ProblemSolution/ProblemSolution.tsx`: Uses the imported `springToCss` function
* `src/shared-components/sections/TechnicalImplementation/TechnicalImplementation.tsx`: Uses the imported `springToCss` function

### 2.2. Dependencies

* `@react-spring/web`: v9.5.5, core animation library that provides hooks for creating spring-based animations
* `react`: v18.3.1, underlying framework requiring proper handling of effects and state
* `react-intersection-observer`: Used alongside react-spring for trigger animations on scroll

### 2.3. Potential Concerns

* Fixing one component might reveal errors in others that were previously masked
* Some components may rely on the current behavior for layout or animations
* We need to ensure fixes don't break existing animations visually
* [x] Mark as addressed

## 3. Architectural Considerations

### 3.1. Updated Paradigm: Migration to Framer Motion

* **Complete Library Replacement** - Replace React Spring with Framer Motion for all animations
* **Feature Flag System** - Implement a feature flag system to enable gradual migration
* **Component-by-Component Migration** - Systematically replace animations one component at a time
* [ ] Confirmed with the user

### 3.2. Selected Design Patterns

* **Adapter Pattern** - Create adapter components that provide consistent interfaces during migration
* **Feature Flag Pattern** - Use feature flags to toggle between animation libraries or disable animations
* **Higher-Order Component Pattern** - Create HOCs for common animation patterns
* [ ] Confirmed with the user

### 3.3. Architectural Considerations & Rationale

* React Spring is fundamentally incompatible with our current usage patterns, causing circular dependencies
* Framer Motion offers a more stable, declarative API that is less prone to these issues
* Framer Motion has better compatibility with Next.js and React 18
* A gradual migration allows us to maintain functionality while replacing problematic components
* [ ] Confirmed with the user

## 4. Project Task List Foresight

### 4.1. Downstream Impacts

* Migrating to Framer Motion will require changes to all animated components
* Visual appearance should remain largely the same, with potentially improved animation performance
* Component interfaces may need to be adjusted for the new animation library
* [x] Reviewed and confirmed no negative impacts

### 4.2. Future-Proofing Considerations

* Create proper documentation for Framer Motion usage patterns
* Implement common animation pattern components for reuse
* Add safeguards to prevent circular dependencies in future animation implementations
* [x] Discussed with the user and incorporated feedback

## 5. Testing Strategy

### 5.1. Available Testing Options

* `[x] Unit Tests`
    * Location: `src/__tests__/components`
    * Command to run all tests: `pnpm test`
    * Command to run a single test: `pnpm test -- -t "ComponentName"`
    * Relevant Knowledge: Verify components render without errors after migration

* `[x] Visual Regression Tests (Storybook)`
    * Location: `src/shared-components/*/stories`
    * Command to run tests: `pnpm storybook`
    * Relevant Knowledge: Verify animations look and behave correctly after migration

### 5.2. Selected Testing Approach

* Test each component in isolation using Storybook
* Enable one component at a time through feature flags
* Verify visual consistency between React Spring and Framer Motion implementations
* Monitor console for errors during and after migration
* [x] Confirmed testing approach aligns with project standards.

## 6. Migration Strategy

### 6.1. Feature Flag System Implementation

Create a feature flag system to safely toggle between animation libraries:

```typescript
// src/utils/feature-flags.ts
export const ANIMATION_LIBRARY = {
  REACT_SPRING: 'react-spring',
  FRAMER_MOTION: 'framer-motion',
  NONE: 'none'
};

export const ANIMATION_CONFIG = {
  // Start with all components using no animations (safe)
  library: ANIMATION_LIBRARY.NONE,
  // Gradually enable components one by one with Framer Motion
  enabledComponents: [] as string[],
  // Enable per-component debugging
  debugMode: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'
};
```

### 6.2. Common Animation Pattern Mapping

| React Spring Pattern | Framer Motion Equivalent |
|---------------------|--------------------------|
| `useSpring({ from: { opacity: 0 }, to: { opacity: 1 } })` | `<motion.div initial={{ opacity: 0 }} animate={{ opacity: 1 }}>` |
| `useTrail(items.length, { ... })` | `<motion.div custom={i} variants={itemVariants}>` |
| `spring.to(val => ...)` | `<motion.div style={{ y }} />` or variants |
| `useChain([ref1, ref2], [0, 0.5])` | Variants with `delayChildren` and `staggerChildren` |

### 6.3. Component Migration Workflow

1. Install Framer Motion: `pnpm add framer-motion`
2. Create pattern adapter components
3. Update styled components to work with Framer Motion
4. Migrate each component, starting with most problematic ones
5. Test in Storybook
6. Enable in main application via feature flags

## 8. Migration Implementation Details

### 8.1. Core Animation Components

Create a set of standardized animation components to replace React Spring:

```typescript
// src/utils/animations/framer-patterns.tsx
import React from 'react';
import { motion, AnimatePresence } from 'framer-motion';

// Fade-in component (replaces useSpring({ opacity }))
export const FadeIn: React.FC<{children: React.ReactNode, delay?: number}> = ({
  children,
  delay = 0
}) => (
  <motion.div
    initial={{ opacity: 0 }}
    animate={{ opacity: 1 }}
    transition={{ duration: 0.5, delay }}
  >
    {children}
  </motion.div>
);

// Additional patterns will be implemented as needed
```

### 8.2. SSR Compatibility

Implement server-side rendering compatibility:

```typescript
// src/utils/animations/ssr-safe.tsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

export function useSsrSafeAnimation(enabled = true) {
  const [isMounted, setIsMounted] = useState(false);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    setIsMounted(true);
  }, []);
  
  return {
    animate: isMounted && enabled ? 'animate' : 'initial',
    shouldAnimate: isMounted && enabled
  };
}
```

### 8.3. Next Steps

1. Start by migrating the `ImpactGrid` component, which has been identified as particularly problematic
2. Implement the feature flag system
3. Gradually enable Framer Motion for additional components
4. Monitor for Maximum Call Stack Size errors throughout the migration
