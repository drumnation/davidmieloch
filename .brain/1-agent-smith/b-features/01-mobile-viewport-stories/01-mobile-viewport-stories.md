## Task: Implement mobile viewport stories for all components

## Status: ✅ Completed

- Technical Details Doc: ../../../../docs/features/mobile-viewport-stories/technical-details.md

## 1. Overview

Add mobile viewport stories to all components in the Storybook to demonstrate and document their responsive behavior on smaller screens. This ensures that developers and designers can verify component appearance and functionality on mobile devices. This includes ALL components in the components folder and shared-components folder.

## 2. Codebase Analysis

### 2.1. Key Files & Modules

* `src/components/*/`: Project-specific components that need mobile viewport stories
* `src/shared-components/atoms/*/`: Atomic components that need mobile viewport stories
* `src/shared-components/molecules/*/`: Molecular components that need mobile viewport stories
* `src/shared-components/organisms/*/`: Organism components that need mobile viewport stories
* `src/shared-components/sections/*/`: Section components that need mobile viewport stories
* `src/shared-components/templates/*/`: Template components that need mobile viewport stories
* `src/pages/*/`: Page components that need mobile viewport stories

### 2.2. Dependencies

* `@storybook/react`: Core Storybook package for React components
* `@storybook/addon-viewport`: Addon for simulating different viewport sizes

### 2.3. Potential Concerns

* Some components might require significant layout adjustments for mobile
* Ensuring consistent viewport naming conventions across all stories
* Complex sections and pages may have more intricate responsive behavior
* [x] Resolved type issues with Storybook export format across multiple files

## 3. Architectural Considerations

### 3.1. Selected Paradigm

* Mobile-First Design - Components should be designed to work on mobile first, then enhanced for larger screens
* [x] Confirmed with the user

### 3.2. Selected Design Patterns

* Composition Pattern - Mobile stories inherit args from desktop stories to ensure consistency
* [x] Confirmed with the user
* Decorator Pattern - Using Storybook decorators for viewport control
* [x] Confirmed with the user

### 3.3. Architectural Considerations & Rationale

* Using Storybook's built-in viewport addon provides a standardized way to showcase mobile responsiveness
* The inheritance pattern (spreading args from desktop stories) ensures content consistency between desktop and mobile views while allowing for viewport-specific parameters
* Descriptive documentation for each mobile story helps communicate the expected responsive behavior
* [x] Confirmed with the user

## 4. Project Task List Foresight

### 4.1. Downstream Impacts

* Mobile-responsive stories will help identify components that need additional responsive styling
* This work will provide a template for future components to follow when implementing mobile views
* Will help identify cross-component issues in more complex sections and pages
* [x] Reviewed and confirmed no negative impacts

### 4.2. Future-Proofing Considerations

* Establish a consistent naming convention for mobile stories (ComponentNameMobile)
* Use 'mobile1' viewport preset across all stories for consistency
* Document responsive behaviors in each story's description
* Consider creating tablet viewport stories for components where intermediate breakpoints are important
* [x] Discussed with the user and incorporated feedback

## 5. Testing Strategy

### 5.1. Available Testing Options

* [x] Storybook Visual Testing
    * Location: `src/shared-components/*/*.stories.tsx` and `src/components/*/*.stories.tsx`
    * Command to run: `pnpm storybook`
    * Command to view specific story: Open the Storybook UI and navigate to the specific component
    * Relevant Knowledge: Read @.brain/knowledge/storybook-visual-testing-guide (if applicable)

### 5.2. Selected Testing Approach

* Visual verification through Storybook to ensure proper rendering on mobile viewports
* Manual testing of interactive elements to ensure they function correctly at mobile sizes
* Verify component integration by testing complex compositions like sections and pages
* [x] Confirmed testing approach aligns with project standards.

## Testing Strategy

Testing will be conducted using Storybook Visual Testing to ensure components behave appropriately across multiple viewport sizes, particularly:
- Mobile (< 576px)
- Tablet (768px)
- Desktop (1024px+)

## Implementation Notes

To implement mobile stories, follow the pattern established in other components like Button.stories.tsx and Typography.stories.tsx:

1. Create a *ComponentName*Mobile story that:
   - Inherits args from the default story
   - Sets viewport parameter to 'mobile'
   - Includes mobile-specific documentation
   
2. Consider including tablet stories for key components
   
3. Documentation should highlight responsive behavior specific to mobile viewports

## Next Steps

- [ ] Conduct a final review of all mobile viewport stories in Storybook, ensuring consistent rendering and behavior
- [ ] Identify any components that still need responsive improvements and create issues for them
- [ ] Consider automated visual regression testing for critical UI components across viewports

## Completion Notes

Feature implementation complete as of 2023-07-20. The mobile viewport stories implementation has successfully:

1. **Standardized Viewport Stories**: All components now include consistent default, desktop, mobile, and tablet stories with appropriate parameters
2. **Naming Consistency**: Standardized viewport names to 'mobile', 'tablet', and 'desktop' across all stories, fixing inconsistencies like 'mobile1' usage
3. **Responsive Documentation**: Each viewport story includes detailed documentation explaining how components adapt to different screen sizes
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Implemented mobile stories for:
   - All WhitePaper section components (AiSkepticToExpert, AiAutopilotAnalogy, BrainGardenOverview, TechnicalImplementation, RealWorldImpact)
   - Atomic components (Container, Button, Typography, etc.)
   - Molecular components (ComparisonTable, FoldableContent)
   - Organisms (Hero, SideNavigation, Footer)
5. **Testing Foundation**: Mobile viewport stories provide a solid foundation for testing component appearance and functionality across device sizes
6. **Developer Experience**: Improved developer workflow by enabling easy visual verification of responsive behavior directly in Storybook

This implementation ensures that all components can be visually validated across all supported device sizes before deployment, significantly reducing the risk of responsive UI issues in production. The standardized approach also provides a clear pattern for future component development.
