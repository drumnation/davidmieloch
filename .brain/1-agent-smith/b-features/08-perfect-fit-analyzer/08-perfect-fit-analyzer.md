## Feature: Perfect Fit Analyzer

## Task: AI-powered reverse-ATS cover letter generator

## Status: ðŸŸ¡ In Progress

## Last Updated: 2025-04-10

- Feature Index: ../../../../docs/features/perfect-fit-analyzer/perfect-fit-analyzer.index.md
- Technical Details Doc: ../../../../docs/features/perfect-fit-analyzer/technical-details.md

## 1. Overview

Create an AI-powered interactive tool that lets visitors upload or paste a job description and receive a GPT-generated analysis showing why Dave Mieloch is the perfect candidate for the role. The tool will use content from the portfolio site, resume data, and optionally company information to generate a persuasive, biased, and humorously confident analysis that can be exported as a cover letter, recruiter pitch, or summary.

## 2. Codebase Analysis

### 2.1. Key Files & Modules

* `app/page.tsx`: Main homepage where the Perfect Fit Analyzer component will be integrated, possibly in the summary section
* `src/shared-components/molecules/`: Contains mid-level UI components where we'll likely create the file upload/paste components
* `src/shared-components/organisms/`: Contains complex components where we'll build the main analyzer component
* `src/components/`: Contains other site-wide components
* `src/utils/`: Contains utility functions for use across the application
* `src/data/`: Contains data sources that may include resume content needed for the analyzer

### 2.2. Dependencies

* `@mantine/core`: v7.17.1 - Used for UI components like modals, tabs, forms
* `@mantine/form`: v7.17.1 - Form handling
* `@mantine/hooks`: v7.17.1 - React hooks for UI functionality
* `@mantine/dropzone`: v7.17.3 - For file upload functionality
* `framer-motion`: v10.18.0 - Animation library for micro-animations
* `styled-components`: v6.1.16 - CSS-in-JS styling
* `pdfjs-dist`: Not currently installed - Needed for PDF parsing
* `mammoth.js`: Not currently installed - Needed for DOCX parsing
* `html2pdf.js`: Not currently installed - Needed for PDF export
* `tesseract.js`: Not currently installed - Optional for OCR capabilities

### 2.3. Potential Concerns

* API key management for OpenAI - Need to ensure secure handling of API keys
* PDF and DOCX parsing complexity - May need to handle various formats and edge cases
* Rate limiting and API usage costs - Need to implement throttling or usage limits
* PDF export quality and formatting - Ensuring the generated PDF looks professional
* Cross-browser compatibility for file operations - File upload and processing needs testing
* Mobile performance and responsiveness - Ensuring smooth experience on all devices
* [x] Mark as addressed

## 3. Architectural Considerations

### 3.1. Selected Paradigm

* Client-Server with API Gateway - Component will make requests to Next.js API routes that act as a gateway to OpenAI and optional web scraping services for company research
* [x] Confirmed with the user

### 3.2. Selected Design Patterns

* Compound Component Pattern - For building the modular UI elements of the analyzer
* [x] Confirmed with the user
* Strategy Pattern - For handling different input methods (upload, paste, clipboard)
* [x] Confirmed with the user
* Factory Pattern - For creating different output types (summary, cover letter, recruiter pitch)
* [x] Confirmed with the user

### 3.3. Architectural Considerations & Rationale

The design for the Perfect Fit Analyzer follows a modular architecture that separates concerns and allows for future extensibility. The application logic is divided into the following layers:

1. **UI Layer**: Using Mantine components and styled-components to create an intuitive interface for file uploading and displaying results. Following mobile-first design principles to ensure optimal experience across all device sizes.

2. **API Gateway Layer**: Next.js API routes will handle the communication with external services (OpenAI API) to keep API keys secure and provide a clean interface for the frontend.

3. **Document Processing Layer**: Specialized utilities for handling different document formats (PDF, DOCX, text) and extracting their content.

4. **AI Prompt Engineering Layer**: A service that structures and sends prompts to OpenAI, including context from the resume and optional company research.

5. **Output Generation Layer**: Components responsible for formatting and displaying the AI responses in different formats (summary, cover letter, recruiter pitch).

This architecture allows for:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Future extensibility to add new input or output types
- Maintainability through modular components
- Secure handling of API keys on the server side
- Efficient UI rendering with client-side components
- Responsive design that works well on all device sizes

Tradeoffs considered:
- We chose client-side rendering for the UI to provide a responsive experience, with backend API routes for secure operations.
- We selected Mantine UI over building custom components from scratch to speed development while maintaining consistency with the existing UI.
- We'll use document parsers like pdfjs-dist and mammoth.js instead of requiring server-side OCR for most document handling, adding optional OCR only as a fallback.
- We're prioritizing mobile performance to ensure the feature remains usable even on slower mobile connections.

## 4. Project Task List Foresight

### 4.1. Downstream Impacts

* This feature adds several new dependencies to the project that will need to be maintained
* The feature introduces a new section to the homepage that may influence the overall site layout
* API keys and usage will need ongoing management and monitoring
* If successful, this feature may inspire similar AI-powered tools elsewhere on the site
* Responsive design considerations may influence layout of other homepage elements
* [x] Reviewed and confirmed no negative impacts

### 4.2. Future-Proofing Considerations

* Implement the feature with a feature flag to easily disable it if needed
* Create a modular architecture that allows for easy updates to the prompt engineering as GPT models improve
* Design the API interface to be model-agnostic, allowing for future switching between OpenAI and alternatives
* Build with rate limiting and usage tracking from the start to manage costs
* Document prompt structures to allow for continued refinement
* Ensure mobile-first responsive design to accommodate future device types and screen sizes
* [x] Discussed with the user and incorporated feedback

    * Focus areas: Component behavior at various breakpoints, touch interactions

### 5.2. Selected Testing Approach

* For this feature, we will use a combination of Unit, Integration, and Storybook tests to ensure comprehensive coverage. Unit tests will validate the parsing utilities and prompt construction logic. Integration tests will verify the full flow from input to AI response. **Crucially, following the Storybook-First approach (@storybook-first-approach.mdc), Storybook will be used for visual testing of UI components and interaction testing for the dropzone and form behavior *before* integrating them into the main application. We will also thoroughly test the responsiveness of components at all breakpoints to ensure a consistent experience across devices.** This approach ensures that each part of the feature works both individually and together as a cohesive whole.
* [x] Confirmed testing approach aligns with project standards.

1. Adding the component to the appropriate page
2. Ensuring proper styling and theming consistency
3. Verifying responsive behavior in the site context
4. Final end-to-end testing of the complete feature
5. Performance optimization if needed
6. Deployment and monitoring

By completing the remaining tasks in sections 8 and 9, the Perfect Fit Analyzer will be fully functional and ready for production use.
