              As AI transforms the workplace, the future belongs to professionals who can span multiple domains.
              We're already witnessing the dawn of hyper-efficient organizations ‚Äì AI-native companies achieving unprecedented results with remarkably small teams.
              The Full-Stack Business Person is someone who combines deep technical expertise with broad business 
              acumen, leveraging AI to perform roles that previously required several specialists.

            <Typography variant="h3" color="primary" mb="1rem">The New Paradigm of Work</Typography>
            
            <Typography variant="body" mb="1.5rem">
              In this new paradigm, developers make product design decisions, contribute marketing copy, 
              and understand sales strategies. Engineers develop business plans, marketing specialists write code,
              and everyone uses AI to fill their knowledge gaps and automate routine tasks.
              Crucially, AI's power is unlocked not just by technical skill, but by <em>asking the right questions</em>. An FSBP possesses the broad <strong>conceptual vocabulary</strong> spanning technology, product, marketing, and sales, allowing them to direct AI agents effectively across diverse tasks far beyond what a narrow specialist could achieve. <strong>This isn't just theory.</strong> We see companies like <strong>Midjourney (AI art) reaching $200M+ revenue with ~40 people, and Cursor (AI IDE) hitting ~$100M ARR with only ~20.</strong> That's roughly <strong>$5 million in revenue per employee</strong> ‚Äì orders of magnitude higher than the ~$125k median for SaaS startups. They achieve this through mass automation and leveraging AI infrastructure ‚Äì capabilities best directed by those with holistic understanding.
            </Typography>
            
            <Typography variant="body" mb="1.5rem">
              These examples demonstrate the raw power of <strong>lean, hyper-efficient organizations</strong> that can indeed outpace traditional structures. AI augmentation allows small teams to achieve what previously required armies. But these high-velocity teams don't run on AI alone. They <em>require</em> individuals who can bridge the gap ‚Äì <strong>Full-Stack Business People</strong> who can wear multiple hats, operate effectively across domains, direct AI strategically, design scalable systems, and make the critical decisions needed to harness this new power. They are the architects and navigators of these lean organizations where communication overhead plummets and iteration speed accelerates.
            </Typography>
            
            <Typography variant="body" mb="1.5rem">
              Furthermore, in these lean, AI-driven environments, strategic decisions carry immense weight. FSBPs understand the full value chain ‚Äì how technology serves product, how marketing informs development, how sales connects to strategy. They make better architectural, product, and go-to-market decisions because they see the bigger picture, ensuring scarce resources are deployed for maximum impact ‚Äì a necessity when a small team aims for massive scale.
