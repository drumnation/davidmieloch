# agent-self-report.rules.mdc

## Purpose
Agents must periodically output a concise self-report that summarizes their active task, goal, current rule context, and execution state. This improves traceability, user awareness, and multi-agent coordination.

## Behavior
- Output a report **after each major action** (e.g., completing a step, switching rules, finishing a prompt, receiving a new instruction).
- Include the following fields:

```markdown
## ðŸ¤– Agent Self-Report
- **Active Rule**: [rule file name]
- **Current Task**: [brief task name or file/folder]
- **Session Goal**: [the high-level objective for this workflow/session]
- **Context Usage**: [Low / Medium / High / Very High]
- **Notes**: [Optional blockers, assumptions, or next action]
```

- The report must be **clearly labeled** and **output in a predictable format**.
- Do not wait for a user request to output this â€” treat it as a proactive behavior.

## Best Practices
- Keep the self-report concise, relevant, and current.
- Always update the rule name if switching to a different rule mid-task.
