# `declare-active-rule.rules.mdc`

**Purpose:**  
Ensure every agent action governed by a rule declares which rule it's using. This promotes transparency, traceability, and effective debugging in rule-driven systems.

---

## âœ… Rule (single line of behavior):

> **When acting on any rule, always start the response with:**  
> `ðŸ”§ Rule: [rule-filename.rules.mdc]`

---

## Example Output:

```
ðŸ”§ Rule: refactor-to-atomic-component.rules.mdc

âœ… Wrapped third-party Mantine `Select` in a reusable `MySelect.tsx` component inside `components/inputs`.
```

### Best Practices:
- Use the *full rule filename* so itâ€™s easy to locate.
- If multiple rules apply, list each on its own line.
- This rule applies **whether the rule is agent-requested, always-on, or manually invoked.**
