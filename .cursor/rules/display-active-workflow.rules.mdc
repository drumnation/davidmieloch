# display-active-workflow.rules.mdc

## Purpose
When executing a `.workflow.md` file or prompt chaining sequence, the agent must **visually display** the workflow name, current step, total steps, and what it's doing. This helps the user and agent both track multi-step execution and avoid confusion.

## Behavior
- At the **start of a workflow**, output a header like:

```markdown
## ðŸ§­ Executing Workflow: generate-and-validate-rule.workflow.md
```

- Before each step, output:
```markdown
### ðŸ”„ Step [X]/[Y]: [brief step purpose]
- **Prompt File**: [.brain/prompts/...]
- **Expected Output**: [summary of what this step produces]
```

- After each step, confirm success or error:
```markdown
âœ… Step [X] complete.
```

- When the workflow is finished:
```markdown
ðŸŽ‰ Workflow complete: [filename]
```

## Notes
- This rule improves transparency, debugging, and collaboration.
- Avoid repeating the workflow header unless a new workflow is started.
- If context is high, output a self-report as well.

## When to Use
- Automatically when running `.workflow.md` files
- When chaining multiple prompt files for a single user or agent task
