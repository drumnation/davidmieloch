# We aren't using tailwind - using it will break the styling

DON'T DO THIS:

<Typography className="mb-4">

The tailwind class just WILL NOT WORK.  

IT IS NOT INSTALLED AND WE DON'T LIKE TAILWIND!

Do not use the className prop. If you see it, remove it and substitute for the most logical substitute.

We use styled components in this app.
