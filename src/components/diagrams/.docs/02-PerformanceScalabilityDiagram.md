# Performance Scalability Diagram Migration

## Source Information
- **Component**: `src/shared-components/sections/TechnicalImplementation/components/PerformanceScalabilitySection/PerformanceScalabilitySection.tsx`
- **Prop**: `performanceScalabilityDiagram`
- **Line**: ~19
- **Usage**: Performance and Scalability diagram showing system architecture for enterprise scaling

## Migration Tasks
- [x] Create new `PerformanceScalabilityDiagram` component in `src/shared-components/diagrams/PerformanceScalabilityDiagram/`
- [x] Implement ReactFlow nodes and edges based on the original Mermaid diagram
- [x] Ensure consistent styling with the AiIntegrationFlowDiagram
- [x] Add appropriate stories for the component
- [ ] Update the `PerformanceScalabilitySection` component to use the new diagram component
- [x] Test the diagram's appearance in all supported themes
- [ ] Remove Mermaid dependency if no longer used elsewhere

## Implementation Details
- Created `PerformanceScalabilityDiagram` component with ReactFlow implementation
- Added support for all four themes (default, dark, forest, neutral)
- Created Storybook stories for each theme
- Used top-down (TD) layout to match the original Mermaid diagram
- Implemented the proper node styling:
  - Performance node: Orange background (#f96)
  - Feature nodes: Blue background (#58f)
  - Optimization nodes: Green background (#5f5)
- Added appropriate accessibility descriptions

## Next Steps
- Test the diagram in the main application context
- Update the `PerformanceScalabilitySection` component to use this new diagram
- Update the migration status in the main tracking file

## Additional Notes
- This component appears in the Technical Implementation section
- Needs to match the visual style and theming of the rest of the application
- The diagram has been implemented based on the Mermaid diagram definition from `TechnicalImplementation.constants.ts`
