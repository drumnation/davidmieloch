# Integration System Diagram Migration

## Source Information
- **Component**: `src/shared-components/sections/TechnicalImplementation/components/IntegrationSystemSection/IntegrationSystemSection.tsx`
- **Prop**: `integrationSystemDiagram`
- **Line**: ~19
- **Usage**: Integration System diagram showing how the system integrates with development workflows

## Migration Tasks
- [x] Create new `IntegrationSystemDiagram` component in `src/shared-components/diagrams/IntegrationSystemDiagram/`
- [x] Implement ReactFlow nodes and edges based on the original Mermaid diagram
- [x] Create simple stories for Storybook testing
- [ ] Ensure consistent styling with the other diagrams
- [ ] Update the `IntegrationSystemSection` component to use the new diagram component
- [ ] Test the diagram's appearance in all supported themes
- [ ] Remove Mermaid dependency if no longer used elsewhere

## Implementation Details
- Component implemented at `src/shared-components/diagrams/IntegrationSystemDiagram/IntegrationSystemDiagram.tsx`
- Follows same pattern as other diagram implementations
- Node layout matches original Mermaid diagram structure
- Basic Storybook stories added to demonstrate each theme

## Additional Notes
- This component appears in the Technical Implementation section
- Integration with section component is still pending
- May require further layout adjustments for optimal display
