# Performance Scalability Diagram Migration

## Source Information
- **Component**: `src/shared-components/sections/TechnicalImplementation/components/PerformanceScalabilitySection/PerformanceScalabilitySection.tsx`
- **Prop**: `performanceScalabilityDiagram`
- **Line**: ~19
- **Usage**: Performance and Scalability diagram showing system architecture for enterprise scaling

## Migration Tasks
- [ ] Create new `PerformanceScalabilityDiagram` component in `src/shared-components/diagrams/PerformanceScalabilityDiagram/`
- [ ] Implement ReactFlow nodes and edges based on the original Mermaid diagram
- [ ] Ensure consistent styling with the AiIntegrationFlowDiagram
- [ ] Add appropriate stories for the component
- [ ] Update the `PerformanceScalabilitySection` component to use the new diagram component
- [ ] Test the diagram's appearance in all supported themes
- [ ] Remove Mermaid dependency if no longer used elsewhere

## Additional Notes
- This component appears in the Technical Implementation section
- Needs to match the visual style and theming of the rest of the application
- May require analyzing the `performanceScalabilityDiagram` prop value to understand the diagram structure
