# Knowledge System Diagram Migration

## Source Information
- **Component**: `src/shared-components/sections/TechnicalImplementation/components/KnowledgeSystemSection/KnowledgeSystemSection.tsx`
- **Prop**: `knowledgeFlowDiagram`
- **Line**: ~177
- **Usage**: Knowledge Flow Diagram showing the system architecture for knowledge management

## Migration Tasks
- [x] Create new `KnowledgeSystemDiagram` component in `src/shared-components/diagrams/KnowledgeSystemDiagram/`
- [x] Implement ReactFlow nodes and edges based on the original Mermaid diagram
- [x] Ensure consistent styling with the AiIntegrationFlowDiagram
- [x] Add appropriate stories for the component
- [ ] Update the `KnowledgeSystemSection` component to use the new diagram component
- [x] Test the diagram's appearance in all supported themes
- [ ] Remove Mermaid dependency if no longer used elsewhere

## Implementation Details
- Created `KnowledgeSystemDiagram` component with ReactFlow implementation
- Added support for all four themes (default, dark, forest, neutral)
- Created Storybook stories for each theme
- Used horizontal (LR) layout to match the original Mermaid diagram
- Implemented the proper node styling:
  - Action nodes: Orange background (#f96)
  - Process nodes: Blue background (#58f)
  - Benefit nodes: Green background (#5f5)
- Added appropriate accessibility descriptions

## Next Steps
- Test the diagram in the main application context
- Update the `KnowledgeSystemSection` component to use this new diagram
- Update the migration status in the main tracking file

## Additional Notes
- This component appears in the Technical Implementation section
- Needs to match the visual style and theming of the rest of the application
- The diagram has been implemented based on the Mermaid diagram definition from `TechnicalImplementation.constants.ts`
