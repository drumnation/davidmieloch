# Knowledge System Diagram Migration

## Source Information
- **Component**: `src/shared-components/sections/TechnicalImplementation/components/KnowledgeSystemSection/KnowledgeSystemSection.tsx`
- **Prop**: `knowledgeFlowDiagram`
- **Line**: ~177
- **Usage**: Knowledge Flow Diagram showing the system architecture for knowledge management

## Migration Tasks
- [ ] Create new `KnowledgeSystemDiagram` component in `src/shared-components/diagrams/KnowledgeSystemDiagram/`
- [ ] Implement ReactFlow nodes and edges based on the original Mermaid diagram
- [ ] Ensure consistent styling with the AiIntegrationFlowDiagram
- [ ] Add appropriate stories for the component
- [ ] Update the `KnowledgeSystemSection` component to use the new diagram component
- [ ] Test the diagram's appearance in all supported themes
- [ ] Remove Mermaid dependency if no longer used elsewhere

## Additional Notes
- This component appears in the Technical Implementation section
- Needs to match the visual style and theming of the rest of the application
- May require analyzing the `knowledgeFlowDiagram` prop value to understand the diagram structure
