# Agent System Diagram Migration

## Source Information
- **Component**: `src/shared-components/sections/TechnicalImplementation/components/AgentSystemSection/AgentSystemSection.tsx`
- **Prop**: `agentSystemDiagram`
- **Line**: ~50
- **Usage**: Agent System diagram showing the architecture and flow of the agent-based system

## Migration Tasks
- [ ] Create new `AgentSystemDiagram` component in `src/shared-components/diagrams/AgentSystemDiagram/`
- [ ] Implement ReactFlow nodes and edges based on the original Mermaid diagram
- [ ] Ensure consistent styling with the AiIntegrationFlowDiagram
- [ ] Add appropriate stories for the component
- [ ] Update the `AgentSystemSection` component to use the new diagram component
- [ ] Test the diagram's appearance in all supported themes
- [ ] Remove Mermaid dependency if no longer used elsewhere

## Additional Notes
- This component appears in the Technical Implementation section
- Needs to match the visual style and theming of the rest of the application
- May require analyzing the `agentSystemDiagram` prop value to understand the diagram structure
