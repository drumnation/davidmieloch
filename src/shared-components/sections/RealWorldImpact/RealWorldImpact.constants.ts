Autopilot, like AI code generation, is a powerful tool for experts. It amplifies their abilities, frees up cognitive resources for higher-level tasks, and ultimately enhances safety and efficiency. However, simply handing an autopilot system to an untrained pilot – or dropping powerful AI tools into the hands of developers without a framework – is a recipe for disaster. It's the difference between a panacea of productivity and a \"superhuman foot gun.\"",
