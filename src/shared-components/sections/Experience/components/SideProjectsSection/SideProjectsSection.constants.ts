As scheduled payments approach their due dates, they appear as "pending" in your forecast. When payments clear your account, you simply mark them completeâ€”automatically updating your bank balance and moving the transaction to next month's list. This dynamic system maintains accuracy between your actual and projected finances while providing flexible scenario planning. Toggle transactions on or off to visualize different financial outcomes, or temporarily disable items to see alternative forecasts. The Month Summary provides key metrics including overall balance change, income totals, largest expenses, and total debtâ€”giving you complete visibility into your financial health with minimal effort.`

Both elements function as powerful navigation tools; clicking any date or chart point automatically selects that date and scrolls to the corresponding forecast transactions in the right panel. This integrated approach transforms abstract financial data into an intuitive visual experience, allowing you to quickly identify trouble spots, plan for upcoming expenses, and understand the long-term impact of your financial decisions.'
