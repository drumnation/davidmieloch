        text: '<p>I have had the privilege to work with David on a project where he composed the music score. David has a an incredible talent for creating mentally stimulating. He is capable of composing for any genre and this has created a large demand for his work in video games as well as independent films.</p><p>Dave also has an amazing ability to learn and master other subjects such as web development. He is mastered the subject to a level where he has built a client base that depends on him. I continue to be amazed at Dave\'s creativity and entrpeneurial spirit.</p><p>One of his major accomplishments has been the development of the "Absurdest Revolution" series on Youtube, which given the scope was no small task. Personally I have found Dave to be a highly intelligent and very easy to get along with. I would recommend Dave highly for his musical talent and creativity.</p>',

        text: '<p>I had the pleasure of consulting to Dave for 6 months at Saturn Business Systems. Dave exhibited an exceptional ability to adopt "value creation fundamentals" including:</p><ul><li>Recruitment and on-boarding of I.T. Governance SMEs to create a "thought lead" ecosystem from which to build differentiated competencies needed to conceive differentiated "whole solutions".</li><li>Re-development of the company website, development of the first "data sheet" and a new communications strategy. This included development of all "content" for digital marketing and social media campaigns (google+, LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, etc..).</li><li>Leveraged alliance relationships to create compelling "white papers" intended to thought-lead the target audience from the perspective of industry-leading SMEs.</li></ul><p>Dave\'s alliance management skills proved critical to the success of helping Saturn develop a unique identity and solidly position itself within the defined market arena of Finance/Banking vertical through a new value proposition. Dave has a rare combination of balancing creativity with pragmatism, a strong work ethic and a high level of professionalism that was instrumental is the success of my consulting engagement.</p>',

        text: '<p>Although I worked with David for a stunted period of time, his work ethic and intense focus made a strong impression on me. He didn\'t waste one minute of time questioning what he was doing or burdening himself with any kind of mental defeat.</p><p>Instead he grew quicker and fast than anyone on my sales floor and while he did that, he also quickly began to contribute and put into place measures that would make the entire team more successful. He was a strong team player.</p><p>I\'m going to miss working with him and look forward to the day when I may have that opportunity again.</p>',

        text: '<p>David is a great person to know! I\'ve had the privilege of working with David for little more than 7 months now and in that time I have known David to be a well-grounded and down to earth business partner and colleague.</p><p>He is a calculated risk taker, genius marketer and realist who seems to grasp ideas holistically whilst still taking note to the acute details as our resident tech guru. I found this to be incredibly valuable in working with him, as it allows him (and for those who work with him) the ability to explore and understand nearly all possible perspectives to an idea and its numerous applications.</p><p>He is an extremely motivated worker and value creator in the truest sense.</p>',

        text: '<p>During the 4 months Dave and I were students together at the Flatiron School, he showed me how far talent, passion, and sheer will can take you. This is a man who knows how to find and solve problems we as users encounter on a daily basis when it comes to interacting with web applications.</p><p>Every one of his projects were meticulously thought out to solve a problem in the real world. Whether it be to increase productivity through a task managing tool or to address user experience concerns in an app we all have on our phone by creating his own iteration, Dave\'s imagination and focus will take him very far.</p><p>I still do not understand how he is able to code for hours on end without taking a break or getting distracted. He is an asset to any company or organization that snatches him up. Unfortunately we were never able to collaborate on a project, but I am sure sometime down the road we will make it happen. It was a privilege to learn from and alongside him.</p>',

        text: '<p>Dave is truly a triple threat. He writes efficient and clever code, is an online marketing wiz and on top of that is also a talented composer. He combines these skills eloquently in the projects he\'s shown me, and is truly a generalist who isn\'t afraid to specialize in the things he is passionate about.</p><p>I want to highlight Dave\'s creative abilities because they extend far beyond his compositional work into his software. Whenever I needed an innovative solution to a problem I was experiencing, Dave was my go to resource. He can quickly shift his perspective when faced with a challenge and this allows him to avoid tunnel vision while searching for a solution.</p><p>He\'s also a talented researcher and a true child of the internet, which meant he was always up to date on the latest and greatest ways of developing for the web. I look forward to collaborating with Dave again in the future, and know that any company would be lucky to have this individual on their team.</p><p>Beyond this he\'s also a joy to be around, Dave is what I would refer to as a "good soul\'."</p>',

        text: '<p>I was given an opportunity to work with David on our first project for school and the amount of creativity and ambitiousness he has is very refreshing. Sometimes it\'s easy to see your limitations and hold back what you want to get done but David doesn\'t let such things get in the way.</p><p>He works very hard and expects his work to be great quality. He was a pleasure to work with and his work ethic is inspiring. We had a great time making our first project and it was something that seemed impossible at the time but his ability to keep going until the very end allowed us to finish successfully.</p><p>I would highly recommend David as I\'ve experienced David\'s personality and work ethic first hand.</p>',
