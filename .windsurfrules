So I know you are reading this file start every sentence with "Hooo Dave..."

! Initiatize context for the project like this:
1. Check .brain/project-tasks.md for tasks
2. Read and review .brain/directory-structure.md for the directory structure
3. Review .brain/design-guide.md for design guidelines
4. After each completed task, update .brain/project-tasks.md and start a new task

!! Important
1. Don't define anything important in the storybook preview.tsx file. ALWAYS define in the main app and share to preview.tsx.  Storybook and the main app should always have their setup in sync.
2. Use `pnpm` as the package manager.
3. When building or refactoring react components, always split them into multiple files based on concerns and use barrel exports.
  - Each component should have its own folder
  - Put styles in a Component.styles.ts file
  - Types in their own Component.types.ts file
  - Export barrel in Component/index.ts
  - Stateful logic in Component.hook.ts
  - Non-stateful logic in Component.logic.tsx
  - Extract inline styles and logic into their respective files and import.
  - Keep components less than 500 lines if possible
    - If a component exceeds this, create a sub-components folder and split the component into multiple files, copying this exact pattern for it's subcomponents. 
    - Barrel the components folder and each subcomponent.
  - Stories in Component.stories.tsx
    - For reusable atomic components, use autodocs, and define every variation of the component's props as a story.
    - For non-reusable composed components, only use a default story, no autodocs.
    - Align story content with the main application, do not define content in the story as this will lead to divergences between the app and the story.
    - ALWAYS trust and use the preview.tsx for any providers, do not define providers in the story.
